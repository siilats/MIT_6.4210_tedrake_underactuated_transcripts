1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 and

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,880
 yeah i'm all excited about being back

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,640
 just uh...

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,460
 some of you

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,880
 so

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,400
 they're having trouble finding us

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,800
 you know i think that uh...

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,400
 my optimism is is window a little bit uh... i think we are

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,400
 occurred

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,800
 at his visit

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
 are available as possible and and getting through it

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,080
 being is created yet to get through that so

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,000
 i don't have all the answers but i'll answer any questions i can answer

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,840
 asking and asking asking

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,040
 there were some alternatives like you know

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,440
 it's the class of saturday mornings at eight thirty a m

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,620
 but that i

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,780
 i think that's it

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,860
 i think that i think this is what we've got

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,020
 uh... yet concerns or questions let me know if it doesn't

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,580
 big classes appealing i totally understand so

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,860
 okay good

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,060
 today we're going to talk so most of the class actually we're going to talk about

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,540
 and uh... the sort of the a_i_ behind

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,460
 but today

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,260
 to get in

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,060
 uh... into it i want to talk a little bit about her

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,660
 give you a sense for the hardware we're going to be thinking about

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,460
 in in the class a lot

30
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,980
 uh... this is the group uh...

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,940
 he would

32
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,020
 in in the flesh if you will and uh... it's been bigger and more real than

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,300
 that it looks on the

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,040
 cartoons

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,100
 uh... brought a few hands

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,140
 uh... danny's got some cool hands in the overflow room too

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,500
 so you guys will be able to

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,260
 uh...

39
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,860
 so uh...

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,540
 let's let's begin so first of all i do want to just remind you that if you do

41
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,960
 uh... useful but

42
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
 all of these some of my click here

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,180
 isn't pointing to this anymore but uh...

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,400
 don't click their click there and uh... but i could even click there right now

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,740
 and anybody can on the textbook right and it opens up the people

46
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,940
 started using

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,140
 he says

48
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,100
 some of you realize that

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,300
 uh... when you duplicate apparently it doesn't show this by defaults you have

50
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,840
 to sort of like if you want to get to the exercise you got to do that

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,200
 anyways uh...

52
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,540
 the chapter

53
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,460
 has some cool things i think it is

54
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,940
 uh... the ability to just drop in any robot provided for

55
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,060
 the people who had more

56
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,380
 and just like you

57
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,820
 move them around get a sense for what they're like

58
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,140
 and it steps you through a bit of what it takes to simulate and some of the

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,300
 more

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,900
 subtle aspects of simulation which we'll talk through on the board a little bit

61
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,780
 playing with the code

62
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,780
 hopefully

63
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,420
 you know there's a lot of hardware out there

64
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,060
 uh... we talked about this

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,820
 the signals and systems the dynamical systems abstraction last time

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,820
 and i want to dig in a little bit more

67
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,660
 so there's this view of

68
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,480
 this sort of pure view of control

69
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,540
 or even uh... in reinforcement learning these days

70
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,980
 you'll see a lot of people that

71
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,500
 draw that simple version of the picture

72
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,900
 where i just have

73
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
 my robot

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,900
 which has some sensors coming out

75
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,500
 actuators is just a slightly more general term than motors, motors i think of as being

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 electric motors, actuators could be hydraulic or anything

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,700
 motors are

78
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,860
 one type of actuator

79
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,780
 and then my control here

80
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,620
 and really your control should take your sensors in and put out the actuators

81
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,340
 and you'll see

82
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,940
 the sort of idealized version of this

83
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,900
 or the stylized version of this

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,620
 in RL maybe I would say

85
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,620
 we're just going to go from pixels to torques

86
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,900
 I actually like that as a charter

87
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,220
 I try to think how do you go all the way from

88
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,180
 if your sensor is a camera

89
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,620
 and ultimately the thing you send to your robot is a torque

90
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,780
 then how do you close that whole loop and what has to happen to make that happen

91
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,380
 but if you look down at the details and it's not just an implementation detail

92
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,940
 I think it's fundamental and it's worth talking about in lecture here

93
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,940
 you know you have some control box that you're allowed to access

94
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,420
 through your drivers to the robot

95
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,620
 your robot

96
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,060
 the EWA actually

97
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,220
 has an input

98
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,700
 that looks like torque

99
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,140
 we'll talk about exactly what it is

100
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,460
 but really most of the robots out there

101
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,920
 don't actually

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,180
 let you send torques

103
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,540
 into the actuators, that's an idealized view of the world

104
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,980
 and it's actually not

105
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,300
 what's happening on most of our robots

106
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,420
 and there's reasons why, you don't want to probably send raw torques

107
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,180
 directly to your robot

108
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,300
 so even if

109
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,060
 ironically simulation often you think about it as just a torque source

110
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,260
 but

111
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,340
 actually there's a lot more going on

112
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,560
 and that can dramatically impact your success or failure with control strategies

113
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,560
 so we'll dig in a little under the covers there today

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,620
 what you find under the covers will depend on which arm you've taken

115
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,900
 so my goal today is to talk a little bit about some of the robot arms out there

116
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,900
 the hardware choices you make matter

117
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,820
 we picked

118
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,900
 the EWA as the one to think about mostly in the class

119
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,180
 I'll tell you why, I'll tell you some of the things that's good about it

120
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,220
 I want to really emphasize this point that

121
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,060
 that physics, the physics engine is a big part of what you need to do the simulation

122
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,300
 but actually

123
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,340
 simulating that control box

124
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,940
 and all the other stuff

125
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,380
 is a big part of simulation too, so simulation is actually bigger than just physics

126
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,820
 and

127
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,540
 even though we're going to abstract a lot of that away with the signals and systems abstraction

128
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,380
 it pays to at least have an awareness of what's happening underneath there

129
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,260
 and then I've got a bunch of robot hands too, we'll talk about some of the cool robot hands out there

130
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,620
 some of the different approaches people have taken to building

131
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,220
 robot hands and we picked a simple gripper

132
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,140
 for class

133
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:07,140
 for this WSG and I'll tell you more about it and why

134
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,420
 okay so

135
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,060
 the mandatory intro robot slide here is that

136
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,940
 you know robots are normally behind a fence

137
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,100
 right this is actually where robots have seen most of their success and even in

138
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,340
 newer fulfillment center kind of

139
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,620
 workflows a lot of times

140
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,860
 robots are behind a fence

141
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,380
 and this is a type of robot that's been incredibly successful in industry

142
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,580
 sometimes it's very powerful

143
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,380
 it tends to be very rigid

144
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,540
 it can move very quickly

145
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,300
 be very accurate

146
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,220
 but it's very different than the sort of

147
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,940
 robots in the home that you might

148
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,620
 that we're starting to envision now

149
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,780
 and there's been a big movement in the last

150
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,100
 twenty years now

151
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,660
 certainly the last ten years

152
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,380
 of trying to make co-bots

153
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,780
 robots that are more

154
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,460
 interactive more

155
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,700
 heavily I guess more willing to

156
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,180
 operate directly in the vicinity of humans and have that be okay

157
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,700
 that's Rod Brooks who unfortunately the company isn't around anymore but

158
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,500
 he started Rethink Robotics thinking about

159
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,060
 how do you make robots that are fundamentally safer to interact with and lower cost

160
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,860
 and that could be like in a bakery and

161
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,660
 not behind a fence

162
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,820
 and maybe the dream is that we're all inspired by the movies I think but

163
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,940
 I love Baymax right and

164
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,100
 we've been working

165
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,060
 on projects that are inspired by Baymax and the like

166
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,180
 okay so

167
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,420
 how do we get to more cuddly robots I don't know

168
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,900
 we'll work through it

169
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,780
 so you know here's some mug shots of some of the robots that you've seen

170
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,620
 probably in robotics papers these days and in robotics labs these days

171
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,700
 you can see a lot of them

172
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,780
 in the building if you walk around

173
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,540
 so there's the UR

174
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,260
 series with the universal robot series there's three five depending on

175
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,980
 the number is the kilogram payload at the end effector

176
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,780
 that's the Rethink

177
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,380
 that's Baxter there's a Sawyer robot

178
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,860
 there's another one you recognize the Kuka

179
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,780
 Konova

180
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,460
 JCOs are actually a great series of robots

181
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,900
 they were originally designed to be on the end of a

182
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
 wheelchair

183
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,660
 so unlike actually most of these

184
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,060
 one of the great things about Konova is it doesn't have a massive

185
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,980
 a massive control box underneath that's hiding it's actually a mobile robot arm

186
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,460
 ABB

187
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,660
 a maker of some of those enormous strong robots has gotten

188
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,100
 come towards the

189
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,900
 Cobot

190
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,980
 with Yumi

191
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,580
 Alberto's lab has a Yumi at least one

192
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,540
 Frank a Panda is a new one that's kind of a

193
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,900
 younger lighter

194
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,540
 less expensive version of the Kuka

195
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,340
 so there's a lot out there

196
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,060
 and I would say it's an extremely exciting time for the field in the sense

197
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,500
 that a lot of people are

198
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,700
 are trying to innovate in cheaper hardware

199
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,940
 potentially

200
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,420
 I think it's easy to argue that

201
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,540
 the robots most of the robots we have today were optimized for the factory

202
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,900
 workflow where they were high precision

203
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,260
 and high speed

204
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,220
 and that's probably not what we need in the home

205
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,460
 there's going to be a new generation of robots coming into the home

206
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,180
 so we're

207
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,300
 we're seeing startups and the like build them starting to build them aggressively now

208
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,060
 okay the fundamental thing that's going on there

209
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,100
 uh... since I asked a question

210
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,980
 why is it not torques coming in but why is it positions coming in

211
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,620
 like what you have to know

212
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,100
 about what's underlying that and that includes this

213
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,380
 Kuka robot it includes almost everything I

214
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,740
 think everything I put on that picture list

215
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,660
 is that they're electric motors driving the robot

216
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,780
 but they're

217
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,780
 you know especially in an attempt to be a lightweight

218
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,740
 mobile robot

219
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
 they try to pick

220
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,260
 small electric motors

221
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,340
 and they make those small electric motors which spin fast but don't produce a lot of torque

222
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,260
 they gear them up like crazy in order to produce meaningful like human scale forces and torques

223
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,620
 okay so you can it's not

224
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,860
 it's not unusual to see gear ratios in excess of a hundred you know

225
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,580
 two hundred kind of gear ratios okay

226
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,540
 and you know mathematically that's just a

227
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,940
 a scaling law that's not a big deal

228
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,700
 but in practice it's a mess so

229
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,300
 I'm trying to remember to stay closer to the

230
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,620
 you'll see me keep going like this and then remembering and then going like this

231
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,940
 so let me just maybe point on here

232
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,980
 okay so

233
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,340
 yeah this is just a just a random picture of a planetary gear box okay but

234
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,100
 you know

235
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,820
 typically in order to get big gear ratios you need

236
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,780
 series upon series of gears

237
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,980
 that involve lots and lots of complex interactions which include

238
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,860
 new sources of friction

239
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,260
 backlash

240
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,300
 you know those gears bend under load there's all kinds of messy stuff there

241
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,780
 okay so

242
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,700
 we'll have you work out a little bit of in a problem set there's some nice details about it but

243
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,140
 you know this there's a simple view of motors which is that

244
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,540
 you know current in is proportional to torque out

245
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,900
 and that I think that is a good model for motors you know with a couple extra details

246
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,100
 until you put it into this gear box

247
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,020
 and then

248
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,180
 this the current you put into the gear box

249
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,100
 is transmuted by some incredibly complicated

250
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,020
 frictional and whatever you know

251
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,260
 backlash effects

252
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,100
 into something that is no longer

253
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,420
 simply proportional to current on the output

254
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,940
 so the conventional wisdom is that if you've got a gear ratio let's say greater than ten or something like this

255
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,620
 then don't expect your current to be proportional to your torque on the output

256
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,140
 so how do you get around that

257
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,820
 there's a few ways that you know this is what leads to position control

258
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,780
 as a defining

259
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:13,780
 concept

260
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,820
 okay huge

261
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:23,820
 nonlinear transmissions

262
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:31,020
 I guess the fact that they're nonlinear is less essential than that they're just unknown and hard to model

263
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,340
 in fact I've seen I mean

264
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,980
 you would expect maybe some of you when you when I say something like that you think

265
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,860
 oh we should learn that in a deep neural network

266
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,820
 and I think you should probably I think people are you know every once in a while

267
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,300
 you hear people saying oh I just you know

268
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,140
 I could totally model that in a deep network but it's

269
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,260
 it's not easy it's not it's you know it's not just that there's like a complicated function

270
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,900
 there's also a hidden state

271
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,580
 there's a discrete state from the backlash back and forth

272
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,140
 you know so every once in a while people say oh you know I

273
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,420
 I don't need a gear box you know I figured I've solved the gear box problem

274
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:10,420
 and then you know we don't hear anymore and then it's you know but one of these times someone's gonna say it and it's just gonna be solved and we're gonna be in a better place

275
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,780
 what people have done instead

276
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,860
 that has been very successful

277
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:22,860
 is you have to add sensors on the output of the transmission

278
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,860
 okay and the first bedrock sensor that we know how to add

279
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:47,660
 we know how to work with we we can you know

280
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,980
 we can totally rely on is a position sensor

281
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,740
 you know you can there's a handful of ways they come

282
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,620
 to geometers and coders optical coders

283
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,780
 the most common but not the only ones

284
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,380
 but basically

285
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,100
 you sense the thing you're specifically trying to control

286
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:11,100
 and position sensors are easy, inexpensive to add

287
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:22,380
 okay so

288
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,020
 you know why are we doing position control

289
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,020
 you know and why are we doing this feedback

290
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,660
 it's almost like the question of you know why are computers doing digital electronics instead of analog electronics

291
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,500
 there's just so much mess in the world there

292
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,540
 and closing a tight feedback loop

293
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,100
 takes care of a lot of that mess

294
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,460
 so what we do

295
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,100
 in the internal control laws

296
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,820
 they typically at the pulse width modulation right down at the electronics

297
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,100
 the high power electronics going to the motor

298
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:00,100
 we're closing a tight feedback loop around that position sensor

299
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:15,300
 okay so

300
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,700
 I mean I think

301
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,860
 the details are can get subtle but

302
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,860
 I think it's perfectly reasonable for our purposes to think of this as sending a motor command

303
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:38,940
 that is proportional to the error in position

304
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,940
 proportional gain

305
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,940
 proportional gain

306
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,620
 it's sort of like a spring law

307
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,820
 a derivative gain

308
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,500
 I have a desired velocity maybe

309
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,260
 I've got an actual velocity

310
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,500
 a lot of times that's zero or perpendicular

311
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 integral gain

312
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:34,820
 mastered it

313
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,300
 D for derivative gain instead of velocity but all good

314
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,340
 so

315
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,420
 what's the right way to think about

316
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,300
 a system like that

317
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,300
 if I have

318
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,140
 some joint with an actuator

319
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,300
 let's say I'm trying to hold up a pendulum that's being pulled down by gravity

320
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,820
 and I'm trying to hold it at some desired

321
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
 let's say I'm trying to hold it horizontal

322
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:13,820
 I'm measuring some angle

323
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,100
 this term here

324
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,980
 is almost acting like a rotary spring

325
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,020
 pulling me back up

326
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,820
 towards that

327
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,900
 equilibrium

328
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,060
 as such

329
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,500
 that term alone

330
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,900
 won't get me all the way to the equilibrium

331
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,020
 it will the spring will pull me

332
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,460
 to fight gravity but at some point it will actually come to equilibrium

333
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,620
 balancing

334
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,260
 gravity with the spring force

335
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,780
 a little bit below

336
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:52,780
 this term adds some damping so you get nice convergence instead of oscillation

337
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,360
 is what's watching that steady state error

338
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,700
 and slowly saying okay I've got to push a little bit more

339
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,620
 to actually achieve my desired

340
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:15,340
 so in position controlled robots conceptually

341
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,860
 I think of kp, kd, and ki as being very big

342
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,620
 the robot is really

343
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,940
 capable of tracking desired trajectories

344
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,100
 with very high accuracy, very high precision

345
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,740
 and it's very stiff

346
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,180
 if you were to bump into it while it's moving

347
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,180
 it's going to move you out of the way

348
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,700
 which is I think an essential point

349
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,820
 what would happen if I put my hand in here

350
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,260
 if I put an obstacle in here that was impeding

351
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,540
 the robot's ability to get to the steady state

352
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,140
 first of all

353
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,420
 if those gains are high this is a really stiff spring so I might already fling against it

354
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,140
 and then if I'm not careful

355
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,020
 I'm going to just push harder and harder and harder

356
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,900
 until I fault my motor basically and my robot will turn off

357
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,780
 and maybe there's smoke

358
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,180
 which did happen one year in a live demo

359
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,420
 not this year

360
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,420
 okay so

361
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:21,220
 so position control is a natural super effective

362
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,140
 effective approach for controlling robots accurately

363
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,660
 but it does run into limitations when you're starting to

364
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,740
 work environments where you have unexpected contact

365
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,860
 where you might bump into things

366
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
 whether it's a human

367
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,700
 whether it's some part of the environment that you didn't expect

368
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,260
 some of these robots are just not well designed

369
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,500
 they're just not meant to be operated in a place where they could suddenly have

370
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,140
 unexpected contact

371
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
 so we're going to

372
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,620
 think a little bit carefully about

373
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,780
 the alternatives and how those play out

374
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,940
 I mean this picture

375
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,580
 does that make sense the basic picture yeah

376
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,780
 you know you could argue that it would do okay

377
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,860
 like it's really not that bad to just kind of

378
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,780
 push up against the obstacle and it got as close as it could

379
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,740
 you know that was a reasonable accomplishing of the objective

380
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,780
 if you have a multi-link arm

381
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,740
 you know

382
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,060
 and they're all these joints are independently trying to achieve their objective

383
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,340
 and they don't realize they're stuck

384
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,660
 you know things can get more ugly more complicated right

385
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,380
 so

386
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,700
 a lot of times

387
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,460
 these gains are set

388
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,580
 the feedback law is set

389
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,100
 on each joint or each motor locally

390
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,060
 and they don't talk to each other

391
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,020
 there's a reason for that that you'll explore in the piece set

392
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:53,020
 but things again things can go wrong when you start having incidental contact

393
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,500
 there's a different approach

394
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,140
 which is actually

395
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,420
 was popularized in our mechanical engineering department that's

396
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,860
 Harry Asada some of you will know

397
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,580
 that's Kamal Yusuf Dumi I don't think he always is holding fish

398
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,740
 sorry I picked a random picture

399
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,540
 but they wrote I mean Kamal's thesis was actually about these direct drive robots

400
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,100
 and

401
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,460
 there's a beautiful book that got published out of that

402
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,620
 thesis work

403
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,860
 and I'd actually recommend it

404
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,300
 it was ahead of its time

405
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,580
 back then to make a direct drive robot

406
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,500
 it meant

407
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,220
 enormous motors like remember I said you know you've got these small motors and you gear them up

408
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,700
 okay if you want to get rid of the gearbox then you end up with an enormous armature on your electric motor

409
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,660
 okay so

410
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,740
 it's just like

411
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,820
 big old motor little arm you know

412
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,180
 like a t-rex or something

413
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,500
 big old motor little arm and

414
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,100
 but when they did when they put their motors in that regime

415
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,220
 then they were able to get very low gear ratios and

416
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,460
 control torque directly

417
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,380
 and that was I think

418
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,220
 you know one of the first times we really got to see torque

419
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,060
 controlled robots in action

420
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,940
 now

421
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,260
 our motor technology has gotten better our designs have

422
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,380
 have evolved

423
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,380
 you can find

424
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:19,300
 torque direct drive or almost direct drive robots in much more reasonable form factors

425
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,620
 even if anybody remembers the Barrett Wham robot which was a

426
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,940
 cable driven robot that was you know eight to one gear ratios because of very clever cabling

427
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,860
 and you know it was a

428
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,660
 fairly lightweight robot that could move around and you thought of that as having torque control

429
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,260
 Songbase group actually has you know has done great work on direct torque control

430
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,140
 in legged robots especially

431
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,500
 okay so there's an idea there which is you just build your robots differently

432
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,220
 in fact

433
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:58,060
 some of the new new robots I told you I thought there's a new new breed of robots that are coming out

434
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,300
 they are closer to direct drive and they're using outrunner motors you know

435
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,460
 this great thing that happened when when drones got popular right UAVs got popular

436
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,060
 everybody started making these outrunner motors and in you know they

437
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,780
 optimize the design and reduce the cost

438
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,900
 and those outrunner motors are pretty awesome for generating a lot of torque

439
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,300
 that's what they just flip the armature out to the you know

440
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,380
 this is a slightly different design of a motor but they're much higher torque lower speed motors

441
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:34,380
 and they are enabling the next some of the next generation of low-cost robots

442
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,140
 okay but

443
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,860
 the KUKA takes achieves some of this in a different way okay

444
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,740
 so we talked about you know what you have a fundamental approach to this is to sort of

445
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,300
 add sensors to the output of the transmission

446
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:57,700
 most people add position sensors but you can also potentially add torque sensors

447
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,460
 okay it's yeah

448
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,540
 [inaudible]

449
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,140
 yep so

450
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,820
 I think the danger here is that

451
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,820
 in order to get good tracking then you end up having a high stiffness here

452
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:21,540
 and I think for moving through position only command it's great

453
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,780
 but when you enter situations where you have unexpected collisions and the like it gets more dangerous

454
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,860
 so I will continue to make that point when I finish with torque control

455
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,940
 but I think it's going to allow us to deal with more uncertainty in the environment

456
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,260
 so can you repeat that question?

457
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
 I can repeat that question

458
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,740
 after the fact yes of course

459
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:53,740
 right so remind us why the question was basically can you remind me why torque control is a desirable thing to have

460
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:01,660
 so this is a blowout of the mechanical design on the inside of every one of the joints on the KUKA

461
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,820
 okay it's incredibly nice design work

462
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,020
 in particular I mean you can see there's a lot of details go into these there's a big harmonic drive

463
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:20,340
 so it is high high gear ratio okay but they have a torque sensor embedded in the output shaft okay

464
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,540
 now torque sensors depending on who you talk to some people say torque sensors are like black magic

465
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,820
 you know you have to like some people get them to work really well but they're really hard to get

466
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,900
 get to be very performant you know I've seen more and more people accomplish that but I think

467
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:44,660
 DLR was the name of the German space agency that did the initial design of these robots

468
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:51,060
 I think they surprised people with how effective a torque sensing based on strain gauges and the like

469
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:57,620
 at the output shaft could be for a high gear ratio robot so this was really an exceptional design

470
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:03,220
 that that changed I would say our thinking about force control in in practical robots

471
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:13,620
 so I say we have torque sensing on the output that implies that we can do something like a low

472
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:21,460
 level feedback loop directly on torque instead of directly on position but it also becomes essential

473
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:27,300
 in these sort of unexpected contact situations so to answer the question in a different way is if

474
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,860
 you want to do things like this you know this is Sammy Haddaden oh I hope my internet's good enough

475
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:40,420
 okay yeah right so this is Sammy when he was a student and he was working with the

476
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,660
 the German space agency and he was making the point of these robots being you know

477
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,980
 human robot interaction and when he talks about human robot interaction this is

478
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:58,500
 physical human robot interaction and there's a great series of videos that I think added to the

479
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:06,180
 impact of that work if you will and you know he's got him if we let it go long enough he'll

480
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:12,820
 he'll hit himself in the head and there's even a series where the robot's got a sharp knife

481
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:19,620
 I wasn't going to show that one but but the fact that they could be moving at high speeds

482
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:27,140
 with an inertial robot detect the changes in torque and stop quickly I mean that's important too

483
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,980
 it's pretty good

484
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,340
 all right yeah

485
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:48,420
 good I'm gonna I'm gonna I hope I land that if I don't answer that in a second so the question was

486
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,980
 why is torque control safer in collisions right and I I think I will land that in a second

487
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:01,380
 okay let's just to say that there's so adding torque sensors is not you know position torque

488
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,380
 sensors and this is not the only approach that has been successful for making torque controlled

489
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,740
 robots atlas actually had torque control we thought of it as having torque control on the legs and it

490
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,260
 was more position control in the arms but atlas this is version one the new one is much more

491
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,020
 it's a beautiful design I mean this was a beautiful design too but it's

492
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,660
 generation one of something even more incredible you know this is a hydraulic robot right so it had

493
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,940
 a big pump in the middle of its chest and it was pumping hydraulic fluid and shunting it through

494
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,620
 these valves in order to control how much force how much work was being done at each at each joint

495
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,220
 and the way that you would measure torque on this was it didn't have a transmission as per se but

496
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,500
 it would have we would measure the differential pressure across the valve and that would be a

497
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,340
 surrogate for torque but not a great one we had to we had to try to calibrate around it a lot okay

498
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:00,500
 but we thought of this as having torque control and and for walking robots a lot of people believe

499
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,500
 that torque control is essential again for interacting with the you know if you don't

500
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,580
 know exactly where the ground is then being able to be in a more torque control mode instead of a

501
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,420
 position control mode is excellent for a legged robot I would say legged robots promoted torque

502
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:21,620
 control early in fact I would say most legged robots try to act like they're in torque control

503
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,340
 when their leg is in contact with the ground and in position control when they're swinging

504
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,020
 and then torque control so they do their best to emulate both

505
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:42,820
 okay if you have torque control and you have an exceptionally good model of your robot

506
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,900
 those two things go well together so this is a part of the answer to your question so

507
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:57,940
 our mathematical models of our robot at the level of torque in motion out you know given by newton's

508
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:05,220
 equations if we can control torque then we can do things like gravity compensation

509
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,540
 so let me actually pause that and tell you what I'm saying

510
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:28,900
 that shows here I think it would be easier for me to stay on this board I guess

511
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:42,180
 so let's talk robot equations okay so the dynamics of our robot whether it's that robot or atlas

512
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:51,380
 the physics of our robot are basically f equals ma right but we're going to do better than that

513
00:31:51,380 --> 00:32:00,420
 so I say f equals ma is my starting point the particular shape of the forces that we get from

514
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:07,380
 gravity and the way we think about we can write out this term for robots that are in the canonical

515
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,460
 manipulator form this set of equations will take on something that will be familiar to you by the

516
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:22,100
 end of the class a slightly more general or I would say it's more specific actually but it's a

517
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,340
 a more tailored version of those equations specifically for our robot case for our rigid

518
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:35,380
 body systems multi-body systems

519
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,140
 so this

520
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,660
 is ma okay and this

521
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:55,460
 is our forces but let me break it down to be clear so we think of this as the mass matrix

522
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:05,300
 for the inertial matrix

523
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:13,060
 okay we should say the q is the

524
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:19,940
 vector of positions generalized positions

525
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,220
 let's say positions for now

526
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,780
 you like the grounding mechanics you know the generalized positions

527
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:39,620
 q dot is the velocity

528
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,100
 q dot is the acceleration

529
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
 so

530
00:33:46,660 --> 00:34:00,660
 we're all for a robot like this these are all joint positions joint velocities joint accelerations

531
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:08,660
 okay now why do I say those terms together this is a coriolis matrix

532
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,620
 so

533
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:21,220
 those terms go together to make up the mass times acceleration

534
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,620
 it would take a longer time maybe to fully convince you of that but

535
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:35,860
 but those two go those are those are the the inertial effects okay and this is my force due

536
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:46,340
 to gravity my force due to gravity

537
00:34:46,340 --> 00:35:00,340
 and this after the view taking it as my controlling force

538
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,460
 so if you were to take a free body diagram for the kuka or for atlas and you would turn the crank

539
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:14,100
 on f equals ma or your electron gene mechanics you would get out something that you could write

540
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:27,780
 in this form now what is gravity compensation okay so gravity compensation is basically

541
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:34,980
 i'm going to choose u to be negative pow g in the simplest form it's just this

542
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:52,980
 so that means you have a model of your robot you know the lengths the masses the inertial

543
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,020
 even potentially the friction sometimes the gravity cap also tries to cancel out the friction

544
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:04,020
 okay and your goal is to basically make your robot act as if it's in you know

545
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,300
 increase on the issers it's taking gravity out of the picture

546
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:17,540
 yeah are they measuring you or are they measuring the entire right hand side it's subtle it's super

547
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,740
 subtle right so the question was is when i have the torque sensors are they measuring you or they're

548
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,060
 measuring the entire right side we're going to actually derive when we get to the force control

549
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:34,420
 part we're going to see the stiffness controller because yeah it's way subtle it's a mixture and

550
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,660
 for a good reason and yeah but that's a great question

551
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:49,940
 okay so so if i were to have gravity compensation and also i should really call it gravity and

552
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,820
 friction compensation because you might also have additional forces here due to joint friction

553
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,500
 okay and you'd like to cancel those out too i won't write them all on the board okay

554
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:08,100
 but these demos of gravity count are kind of like how you strut your stuff if you've got a force

555
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,260
 controller and you want to say like i've got a good model of my robot i've got a good force controller

556
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:17,380
 then the demo you do to make people ooh and ah is you you put it in gravity count mode and you make

557
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:23,140
 it look like it's not there right that's success and so that so that's what i was showing here

558
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
 ah come on

559
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:32,900
 sorry for those of you following along just click again

560
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:48,340
 okay so you know you're in space or something and someone just pushes you

561
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:53,300
 the robot has a lot of friction in its joints it's got a lot of inertia he shouldn't be able

562
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:58,740
 to push it with his pinky his pinky right this is you know you can even see him smiling you know

563
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:04,500
 this is this is how you show off when you've got really good torque control right

564
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:13,300
 okay so again that's that's not just good torque control that's also a good model of your robot

565
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,140
 because you need to know what torques to apply

566
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:24,980
 all right so now torque control plus good model is the longer answer to your question of how does

567
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,980
 that make me do better against contact okay

568
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:45,860
 so um let me i'm going to just cartoon the idea of we're going to do the

569
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:54,740
 the real derivation once we have more tools but i think i can get the basic idea enough

570
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,740
 to realize why we fixed you out here

571
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:06,580
 so stiffness control is roughly let's say gravity plus inertia plus the force

572
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:21,060
 okay so stiffness control is roughly let's say gravity and friction

573
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:32,580
 compensation approximately plus the pid controller

574
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:43,860
 the simplification bugs me a little bit but but i think it's still the right way to

575
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:51,300
 talk about it here so um so let's think about even in our simple example here okay so

576
00:39:52,100 --> 00:40:01,300
 i draw my pendulum again i've got gravity pulling down on me mass okay i'm trying to go to the

577
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:07,780
 horizontal so um remember i said that the pid control was error driven yeah

578
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,260
 all right are you talking about the pid position error or the torque error?

579
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,780
 ah good this is for pid position control

580
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:26,900
 so when we talked about pid position control only you know trying to regulate this we said

581
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,620
 it was an error driven controller the gains had to be high and then i would have an integral term

582
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:40,900
 that took out the slot okay most of that was just trying to compensate for this gravity term that

583
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:50,340
 we didn't know about okay if i add in an extra term that just removes the gravity portion then

584
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:57,060
 what that effectively lets me do is turn the gain way down on my pid control okay this is the longer

585
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:03,220
 answer to the question right is that um i can even i can even show it so let's think about this as a

586
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:09,300
 as our equations of motion of our pendulum are super easy especially if i think about it in

587
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,820
 steady state at steady state i must have a torque being applied here that has to balance

588
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:28,340
 mdr in order for those to be in balance right if i say i'm going to apply that

589
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:33,700
 i'm going to find that torque with just p control

590
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:42,100
 and that

591
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:51,060
 that in order to derive this

592
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:57,140
 to be a small error i need to choose kp and kb to be large

593
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,260
 if i instead choose for my controller

594
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:12,500
 i have to be a little realistic i don't know the mass exactly i'm going to approximate it

595
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:18,180
 gravity i can pretty much say i know exactly i'll say that's not approximated i use the path

596
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,700
 as an estimate

597
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:31,140
 let's say i just put in a gravity term that i expect to be happening and then my

598
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,700
 a e

599
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:40,660
 a b term

600
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:53,460
 now if m and l are spot on and that's just going to cancel out this term the only work this has

601
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,500
 to do is if there's some unexpected disturbance in the world okay but my mathematical model that

602
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,900
 those that those should do no work i didn't it's out of the zero so the only thing i have to respond

603
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,740
 to is not the friction in the joints the gravity i'm restricting i'm targeting my feedback just to

604
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,420
 the unexpected things in the world as a result i can choose these things to be much lower

605
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:25,780
 and that matters in practice right so there's demos that we have done that i even showed you

606
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:32,740
 before that you know i always think of the the dish when we open the dish rack or the dish

607
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:41,300
 washer door okay like we don't know exactly where that door is we kind of approximated it we pulled

608
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,260
 it down you know if we if we were just a little bit off and we you know we pulled it down it's

609
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:54,100
 got some constraint here and then we even shove the thing from the top okay if we didn't use a

610
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:00,980
 low stiffness control mode for that we would have been highly dependent on the accuracy of that of

611
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,700
 all those transformations if we weren't exactly dead on and we didn't carve out exactly the right

612
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:12,660
 curvature in our arm then that wouldn't that demonstration wouldn't have worked okay the

613
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,340
 position controlled robots have a much harder time dealing with any of the uncertainty or tolerances

614
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:25,780
 okay in the from the world you know this we just make it kind of soft and squishy and if it's i

615
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:31,380
 would be surprised if we were very close to the desired trajectory i would guess that the hand

616
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:38,580
 being in the um you know in the slot there as we execute that i should try to make a plot i would

617
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,300
 guess that we were pretty far off our originally intended trajectory because it was then letting

618
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:51,620
 itself bend to the will of the dishwasher tool right so for me force control and having a good

619
00:44:51,620 --> 00:45:01,620
 model can dramatically change the way you interact with the environment you can do like you can get

620
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,700
 incredible performance out of a position control loop and you can make a torque a great high

621
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:11,620
 bandwidth torque control loop like a position control loop you know mathematically you can

622
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:18,180
 you can do anything sort of you can make one look like the other all of these details become in the

623
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,300
 quality of the signal that you're measuring the bandwidth of your controller you know it's all

624
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:33,860
 the details that make one of those better or worse than the other any questions on that

625
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:48,980
 oops okay so um let's think a little bit about how we actually um model some of this stuff so

626
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,380
 maybe i i convinced you that there's at least a little bit more going on the sort of gravity

627
00:45:53,380 --> 00:46:00,660
 comm there's a pid control maybe going on okay so when i go to give you an abstraction which is

628
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:06,180
 this robot station which has an ewa it has a hand we didn't bound in time we didn't or i didn't want

629
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,300
 to break off in the elevator there's cameras around we're giving you some abstraction but

630
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:16,340
 the details under there are not just the physics of the arm they're also the control cabinet and

631
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:26,020
 all the other stuff okay so we have concepts for all of these things in the system's way of thinking

632
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:35,860
 okay

633
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:52,420
 okay so the f equals ma are the manipulator equations

634
00:46:52,420 --> 00:47:04,100
 okay we do think of that as a mathematical model that takes torques in and has positions

635
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:13,700
 and velocities out okay you know in break is called multibody plant

636
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:29,620
 term plant comes from controls weird but we all know and love it okay and because it's a

637
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:36,500
 many-body system so we are leveraging all of the structure that you get from recursive equations

638
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:45,300
 of motion and the like okay you can make multi-body plants of all of your robots very easily right

639
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:51,300
 the multi-body plants are such a common thing to simulate that there are description formats

640
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:57,380
 that you just basically find on the web a description format for your favorite robot

641
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:04,580
 this is the this is the one for the ewa it's in xml format this is the sdf is one of the robot

642
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:11,700
 description files and you just type in you know where the what are the inertial properties you

643
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,100
 know what are the meshes that define it you know what are the material properties of those meshes

644
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:22,180
 the relative transforms between the different links and there's just text files that will

645
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,620
 basically in which you almost never have to author because you can just download when you're

646
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:32,020
 building your own robot you author the file okay but for for the robot itself you tend to just find

647
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:37,380
 those okay the suppliers the robot makers will supply those files at this point okay and you

648
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:43,460
 can just parse that directly into the multi-body plant okay and that will do that you'll do that a

649
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:51,460
 little bit if you go through the chapter notes so that gives you this you know this first system now

650
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:57,860
 the multi-body plant can be used in many different possible ways the one we're talking about here is

651
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:03,460
 the actuation input port which we're thinking of as tau and we're getting

652
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:11,700
 continuous state out is q and q dot okay but as you can see you can get reaction forces out you

653
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,900
 can get contact forces out you can apply disturbance forces in there's it's a general physics engine

654
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:27,620
 sitting inside okay but the way we the first pass that we'll take the simplest version of modeling

655
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:34,020
 the controller box is going to happen in a few steps so we're going to have this inverse dynamics

656
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:38,820
 controller here which is an approximation of that stiffness controller

657
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:53,860
 okay so what does inverse dynamics do i already have the equations

658
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,020
 we'll go through this in more detail when the time comes but i can i just want to give you the

659
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,620
 sense today

660
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:10,260
 so given those manipulator equations there's two canonical problems with them

661
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:20,840
 sense the A. So given those modulator equations,

662
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,480
 there's two canonical problems with them.

663
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,440
 One is the forward dynamics, which

664
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:42,920
 is given q, q dot, q u, output q double dot.

665
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,380
 There's the inverse dynamics.

666
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:58,840
 Given q, q dot, q double dot, tell me what u I need

667
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,840
 to apply to achieve that acceleration.

668
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,820
 Yes?

669
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,300
 Is there a difference in what is the difference

670
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,760
 between a forward kinematics and a reverse kinematics?

671
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,600
 No, that's great.

672
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,400
 So we're going to do forward kinematics and the like too.

673
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:23,720
 I think in both cases, well, the notion of an inverse problem

674
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,640
 is common in lots of different domains.

675
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,520
 So the only thing that's, I would say,

676
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,920
 different about the inverse kinematics in the sense

677
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,640
 is that I think of the forward kinematics as being very easy

678
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,560
 and the inverse kinematics as being potentially

679
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,360
 under-specified or whatever.

680
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,720
 In this case, somewhat oddly, the forward dynamics

681
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,640
 is actually a little bit harder.

682
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,400
 Well, it's in the simple case where

683
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,480
 you have enough actuators, one actuator for every joint,

684
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,600
 then actually the inverse dynamics is easier.

685
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,080
 I can just plug in my terms on this side

686
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,960
 and just get u out.

687
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,040
 The forward dynamics, ironically, I actually

688
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,440
 have to at least have to take an inverse of this matrix, which

689
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,360
 is more expensive.

690
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:18,880
 The forward dynamics is what you need for marching a simulation

691
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,760
 forward.

692
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,320
 There are many reasons to think of it

693
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,240
 as the more essential dynamic quantity,

694
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,280
 and this is more of a control quantity.

695
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,000
 But you're going to see those connections.

696
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:29,800
 Good question.

697
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,640
 And I don't know if I repeated the question,

698
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,200
 but the question was, are there similarities between forward

699
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,400
 and inverse dynamics?

700
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,120
 You can yell at me immediately if you want.

701
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,640
 I'm doing better.

702
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,680
 OK.

703
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,360
 So the inverse dynamics controller

704
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,960
 takes in an estimated state and a desired state.

705
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,280
 So it's actually going to--

706
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,880
 requires that information to come in

707
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,400
 to know where the robot is actually in,

708
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,000
 what state it's currently in in order

709
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,320
 to compute these quantities.

710
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:15,400
 You also pass in q and q dot desired.

711
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,200
 OK.

712
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,800
 And then there's also a desired acceleration,

713
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,160
 an optional player acceleration.

714
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:29,200
 If you read the fine print, this inverse dynamics controller

715
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,400
 is actually doing a little bit more than just computing

716
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,800
 the inverse dynamics.

717
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,400
 It's also closing a PID loop on this,

718
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,520
 so it's doing something like our stiffness control inside it.

719
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,520
 Even inside here, if we were to open it up,

720
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,000
 we'd see a couple of different layers of complexity inside it.

721
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,160
 OK.

722
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,800
 And then still from here, I have to get all the way out.

723
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:03,040
 All I actually send to my EWA is a desired condition.

724
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,160
 OK.

725
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,600
 So there's even another step here, which if I step out,

726
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,800
 I have to somehow model the way that this control

727
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,440
 box is taking a stream of position commands,

728
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,360
 differentiating it, inferring from a stream of position

729
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,360
 commands of an intended velocity also.

730
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,120
 And it's this state interpolator through this creeper.

731
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:41,160
 OK, so I would say this is still a relatively coarse level

732
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,640
 of fidelity.

733
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,680
 We're getting super high quality simulation of that robot.

734
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,040
 You can go in finer detail.

735
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,840
 You can talk about exact control rates.

736
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,240
 You can talk about encoder counts.

737
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,600
 You can talk about quantized this and that.

738
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,760
 This one has served well.

739
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,800
 At some point, this is a good enough model of the robot

740
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,880
 that the stuff you're bumping into in the world

741
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,800
 dominates my lack of modeling of the encoder counts.

742
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,520
 But I actually think you can do better

743
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,600
 without watching too much work.

744
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,680
 And I really mean it to be another example of this idea

745
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,800
 of somehow that we're encapsulating this as this is

746
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,120
 just the physics part of the manipulation station diagram.

747
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:38,360
 There's also the cameras and other things

748
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,440
 that are all mocked inside there with proper simulations.

749
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:51,200
 What's the QD outside and the QD inside different?

750
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,440
 One is position, one is torque?

751
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,560
 They're the same.

752
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,040
 In fact, so this system, it actually

753
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,560
 just passes through the desired position, takes a derivative,

754
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:07,840
 and turns it into both position and velocity,

755
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:13,080
 which is our best guess at the first level of implementation.

756
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,760
 It's our simple model of what we think is happening inside.

757
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:27,400
 This would not be a great model of a much stiffer position

758
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,560
 controlled robot.

759
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,440
 This is something that is more unique.

760
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,840
 And in particular, I get to pick the gains

761
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,280
 to be much lower in these controllers

762
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,800
 in order to model that robot complying to the dishwasher.

763
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,920
 I'd say the other reason we picked EWA

764
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,760
 is because it doesn't break.

765
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,520
 And that really matters.

766
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,720
 It just really always works.

767
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,760
 We've blown a fuse once or twice,

768
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,960
 but you just go to the hardware store

769
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,160
 and get a new fuse, roughly.

770
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,920
 And it is a luxury to work on a robot.

771
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,160
 I worked on walking robots often that I built myself,

772
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,320
 which always broke.

773
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,040
 And then, I mean, Boston Dynamics robots

774
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,000
 didn't break very much.

775
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,400
 But still, to have this almost never break

776
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,960
 is really pretty cool, especially if we're

777
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,120
 doing class projects on it.

778
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,140
 Of course.

779
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,560
 So to find the gains for the controller in simulation,

780
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,800
 do you have to do a lot of experiments on the hardware

781
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,360
 to ID those gains?

782
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,720
 So that's a great question, which I will repeat.

783
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,280
 How do you find the gains in simulation?

784
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,080
 The first point is actually, because we

785
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,360
 don't model the extra details, the gains in simulation

786
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,120
 tend to be different than the gains in reality.

787
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,080
 So that is one of the places where I think

788
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,880
 Sim2Real is not happening.

789
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,640
 We carry two sets of gains.

790
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,160
 And yes, we tune them separately to get a--

791
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,320
 you can do it through a full system identification.

792
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,920
 We tend to approximate it and get pretty close

793
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,360
 with some round numbers.

794
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,440
 That's a great question.

795
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:11,520
 Any other questions on torque sensing and control

796
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,480
 or why we picked Evo?

797
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:23,320
 OK.

798
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,880
 I also made the point that physics

799
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,120
 is a piece of simulation.

800
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,680
 And we didn't even simulate cameras or anything yet

801
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,640
 or sensors.

802
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,680
 But simulation really is a lot bigger than just

803
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,040
 having a physics engine.

804
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,600
 OK, let's talk about robot hands.

805
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,640
 I've got some fun robot hands here.

806
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,960
 This is what I think of when I think of robot hands.

807
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:49,800
 I think of the fully dexterous hand.

808
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,080
 This is an Allegro.

809
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,800
 This is the shadow hand.

810
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,920
 They're always holding light bulbs or something fragile.

811
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,560
 An apple is a common--

812
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,360
 a lot of glamour shots with robot hands holding apples

813
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,600
 for some reason.

814
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,080
 OK, but you don't see as many robots using those hands

815
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,520
 as you'd like.

816
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,680
 Allegro is starting to get more popular, I would say.

817
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,360
 But as beautiful as they are, they

818
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,200
 are bigger than you might think, first of all.

819
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,240
 The shadow hand is actually pretty close

820
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,120
 to human form factor.

821
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,640
 The Allegro hand is bigger than the human hand.

822
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,200
 They're not as wonderfully dexterous as the human hand

823
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,960
 yet, and they break a lot.

824
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,520
 Unlike this, these things break a lot.

825
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:41,880
 I actually think if you've seen this open AI finger

826
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,160
 gating example, if you talk to the people who did that,

827
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,840
 or I think even said it in the articles,

828
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,560
 but that's a shadow hand.

829
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,640
 I think they spent--

830
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,080
 I mean, they banged on that hand.

831
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,380
 They were doing reinforcement learning hours and hours

832
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,880
 a day on that hand.

833
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,440
 And I think there was a lot of work

834
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,480
 trying to make that hand more robust enough

835
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,480
 to survive the experiments.

836
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,440
 It was a major engineering effort to keep that hand going.

837
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,880
 And there's an argument that you don't need it.

838
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,880
 So here's the argument.

839
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,800
 I think you could go to the toy store

840
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,680
 and buy one of these things for $1.99 or whatever.

841
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,200
 And if I asked you to do some really impressive thing

842
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,400
 in the home, like fold my laundry or something

843
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,960
 like that, I bet you could do a pretty good job

844
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,440
 with those little grippers.

845
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,560
 So I think, of course, having a fully dexterous hand

846
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,920
 would be enabling.

847
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,560
 But if you've got good software up here,

848
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,000
 I think you can probably do pretty well

849
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,520
 with a pretty simple hand.

850
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,800
 So that has taken--

851
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,480
 there's a different camp, I would say,

852
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,760
 in the robotics manipulation world, which

853
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,200
 does the simple hand version of this.

854
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,960
 This is a famous video of the PR2

855
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,160
 when it was just being born.

856
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,120
 And it's being tele-opt in this video.

857
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,480
 So this is a long time ago now.

858
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,640
 But it was just like, OK, two-finger gripper.

859
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,040
 This robot can do anything you want in the home, basically.

860
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,680
 This would be a totally useful robot in the home,

861
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,560
 despite having relatively simple kinematics and especially

862
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,520
 very simple hands.

863
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,200
 There's a whole series of these videos.

864
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,040
 They're like getting beer out of the fridge

865
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,560
 and all the things that you want.

866
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:30,680
 So the Shunk WSG, which is what we picked here--

867
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,000
 it's right here.

868
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 You can put whatever fingers you want on it.

869
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,600
 You'll see us using lots of different fingers

870
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,280
 and lots of different applications.

871
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,080
 But it's sort of the IWA equivalent

872
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,320
 of the two-finger grippers.

873
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,400
 So you can get two-finger grippers at the Toy Store

874
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,160
 for $1 or whatever.

875
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,280
 You can spend $15,000 on this.

876
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,280
 And you get force control, basically.

877
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,920
 And an incredible amount of logic,

878
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,160
 which is hard to simulate, that will squeeze until it thinks

879
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,200
 it shouldn't squeeze anymore and not overheat

880
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,400
 and do a lot of clever things, which are sometimes--

881
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,240
 you wish it would just do the linear equation.

882
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:16,080
 But it's been a very good hand in terms of a high-quality hand.

883
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:20,600
 It's the luxury two-finger gripper, I guess.

884
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,920
 But I'd say most of the story we took from the IWA

885
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,280
 is also the same reason here.

886
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,200
 Maybe we needed a little less here.

887
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,040
 I don't know if we're getting as many benefits of force control

888
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,000
 when we squeeze our fingers together.

889
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,920
 I brought a few other hands.

890
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,040
 And Danny, who's in the other side, has the Sandia hand.

891
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,360
 So we actually have a bunch of robot hands around the lab.

892
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,480
 Many of them were on Atlas at one point.

893
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,480
 We were trying lots of different hands.

894
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,240
 And we learned a lot about robustness of hands

895
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,920
 by trying to have a 400-pound humanoid pick up lumber and stuff

896
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,280
 like this and occasionally fall down

897
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,520
 because your walking algorithm is still in development.

898
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,640
 And you land on your hand, and that's not

899
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,680
 what they want you to do.

900
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,000
 It voids your warranty instantly.

901
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,680
 So pretty much every cable on any one of these hands has been broken.

902
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,800
 And despite having this beautiful dexterous Sandia hand that actually

903
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:27,040
 has cameras in its palm, we ended up doing most of the competition

904
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,600
 with this Robotique, the one in the bottom corner

905
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,000
 here, which is a Robotique three-finger gripper.

906
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,040
 In fact, the one Danny has with her is battle scars.

907
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,040
 It looks like it survived a nuclear war

908
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:49,400
 because I think Atlas did fall on it in the competition, unfortunately.

909
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,160
 But there's a lot of great hands out there.

910
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,320
 This is a very clever one.

911
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,280
 It's underactuated in the sense that it's got clever four-bar linkages.

912
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,680
 And when you just close the hand like this,

913
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,560
 whatever object it happens to be coming into contact with,

914
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,880
 it will close its hand around that object

915
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,520
 without knowing what the object is, just using the clever four-bar linkage

916
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,280
 mechanics of the hand, which is super, super good.

917
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,360
 This is the iHiHand, which is a collaboration between iRobot

918
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,160
 and Harvard and Yale.

919
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,240
 It was similarly underactuated and cable-driven, nice and light

920
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,720
 and good, although we did get stuck carrying a 2x4 for a long time

921
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,320
 because we snapped the cable.

922
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,000
 It was a really bad day.

923
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,960
 There's also some things that don't look anything like a human hand.

924
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:43,120
 So this is one of my favorite extreme examples,

925
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,000
 which is one of the jamming grippers.

926
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,200
 So it's a bag of coffee beans, roughly.

927
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,920
 You put it on the end of a hand with some suction on one end.

928
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,160
 And when there's no suction, no pressure, the coffee beans move around

929
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,200
 and it's just this flexible hand.

930
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:05,400
 But then when you suck, you get a jamming effect on the granular media.

931
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,480
 And basically, it will retain its shape, even jam onto the objects.

932
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,800
 And this little jamming gripper can pick up pretty much anything.

933
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,320
 And they picked up all-- I mean, really impressive-- eggs.

934
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:15,820
 See?

935
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:20,160
 See apples and eggs.

936
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:28,600
 So I think there's something to be said that maybe we're overly fascinated

937
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,240
 with the human hand and we should just be willing to explore more.

938
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,320
 I mean, there's a lot of people now using suction in applications,

939
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:41,160
 which I think makes total sense for a lot of applications.

940
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:41,660
 OK.

941
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:48,200
 There's also a variety of soft hands, which,

942
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:52,920
 depending on which boutique lectures we end up with,

943
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,360
 we might talk about some soft hands and the like.

944
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:01,320
 This is-- these are like gelatinous fingers, right?

945
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:07,160
 That use changes in pressure to do roughly the OpenAI--

946
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,880
 and this is obviously a play on the OpenAI demo.

947
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:15,560
 But you can see all skills are executed without any sensory feedback.

948
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,600
 So there's really an argument-- oh, I didn't

949
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,200
 know they actually directly head-to-head themselves

950
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,920
 with the OpenAI in the video.

951
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,120
 But there are some beautifully clever soft hands

952
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,800
 that can do a surprising number of dexterous things.

953
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,240
 Now, I think there's still a debate about how far we're

954
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,720
 going to get with those fully squishy soft hands.

955
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,040
 Like, it might be hard to button my shirt or some-- you know,

956
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,500
 dress shirt or something like this.

957
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,120
 I think there's probably things that it wouldn't be very good for yet.

958
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,080
 But probably the evolution of hands will be something

959
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,040
 like those kind of soft things and the fully dexterous things.

960
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:55,540
 We'll see.

961
01:06:55,540 --> 01:07:08,020
 This is a soft two-finger gripper that was done at TRI.

962
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:12,700
 It's got big bubble sensors and the big bubble grippers.

963
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,540
 So-- but one of the great things about it is it's got cameras behind

964
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:18,060
 the gripper and these dot patterns.

965
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,340
 They used to be depth cameras.

966
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,620
 Now they're even just RGB cameras.

967
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:29,460
 And so you can see through the skin and basically get

968
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,820
 some tactile sensing back also.

969
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:36,060
 That's an evolution of a lot of important ideas

970
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,300
 that I will talk about.

971
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,380
 But we're starting from gel-site and gel-slim.

972
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,900
 And there's a lot of related work that I'll tell you about.

973
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:47,700
 But-- OK, wait a second.

974
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,900
 So I have to set this up.

975
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,460
 Best robot video ever.

976
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,260
 Maybe.

977
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:52,780
 Maybe.

978
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,540
 But certainly one of my-- when I get asked,

979
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,220
 like, you're at a robot conference

980
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,060
 and you have to write your favorite robot on your name tag,

981
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:02,100
 right, to this icebreaker.

982
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:05,540
 I always say this robot, OK?

983
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,700
 This is a normal robot hand where they basically

984
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,660
 took all the safeties off and overclocked the motors,

985
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:14,220
 like, just beyond reason.

986
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,820
 And they did the same thing with these gimbal-based cameras

987
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,300
 to track things, OK?

988
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,860
 And this is like--

989
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,740
 probably the robot smokes if it's

990
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:26,980
 run for more than a minute.

991
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,300
 But they do just incredible things with this robot.

992
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:40,300
 OK, here we go.

993
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:43,380
 Dribbling, right?

994
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:44,020
 And spinning.

995
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:52,060
 OK, here we go.

996
01:08:52,060 --> 01:09:02,140
 It's also, like, giving us the finger at the same time.

997
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:05,620
 [LAUGHTER]

998
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:18,580
 I hope the best one's at the end of the video.

999
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:28,060
 That one's pretty good.

1000
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,540
 Let me see if I can get ahead.

1001
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,740
 [LAUGHTER]

1002
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,240
 Whoa.

1003
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:42,940
 Yeah, I'm going to skip ahead to my favorite.

1004
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:49,780
 Let's throw a cell phone up and catch it just like that.

1005
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,700
 Whoa.

1006
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,500
 That's the best one.

1007
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:58,540
 So I think, you know, who knows if our hands are

1008
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,020
 going to be like that in the future.

1009
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,900
 But it's nice to dream.

1010
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:06,780
 Cool.

1011
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,460
 That was what I wanted to discuss today.

1012
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,740
 Any other questions?

1013
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:20,340
 That's the Ishikawa group.

1014
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,100
 Yeah, I think I almost certainly referenced it in the notes.

1015
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:24,780
 I love that hand.

1016
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:28,260
 I think-- so I met some of the people that worked on it.

1017
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:31,020
 And I don't think they caught the phone very often.

1018
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,620
 You know, like, that was a pretty good shot.

1019
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,860
 But the hardware is just awesome.

1020
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,360
 But the hard work was awesome.
