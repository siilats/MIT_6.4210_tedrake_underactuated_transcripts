1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 OK, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,180
 So this is the last boutique lecture.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,680
 And it will include, actually, a little bit of just reflecting

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,420
 on what we did over the course.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,580
 I find it's useful to sort of say it back in a slightly

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,780
 different way at the end, I hope.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,940
 But we're going to talk today a little bit

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,900
 about soft robotics.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,460
 I don't want to say we're going to cover all that there is

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,740
 to say about soft robotics.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,860
 And its implication for manipulation

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,660
 and for tactile sensing.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,580
 So when we started way back, lecture two,

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,220
 we talked about robot hardware.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,620
 We talked about the EWA, why the EWA was cool.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,540
 I also showed a bunch of cool hands,

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,340
 including some very unconventional hands.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,540
 One was made out of jamming grippers, like coffee beans.

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,860
 And some of them are unquestionably soft.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,540
 So this was just one of the ones that I showed

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,780
 was doing pretty dexterous manipulation

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,580
 with pretty floppy fingers.

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,140
 So I want to explore with you today

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,140
 what it is about being soft that could be good, what

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,940
 are the pros and the cons, and give you

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,500
 a quick sense of what's out there

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,580
 and what people are doing.

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:32,100
 So I mean, I've been interested in soft for a pretty long time.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,140
 But there were a few--

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,660
 I think it's kind of a punctuated evolution

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,820
 of my relationship with soft.

32
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,980
 And in particular, there were a couple results out there

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,660
 that really captured my imagination.

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,340
 This is one by Alex Alsbach, who--

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,100
 oh, I didn't mean to leave the music on.

36
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,300
 Sorry for that.

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,460
 I normally turn those off.

38
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,780
 OK.

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,460
 He was working at Disney.

40
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:08,460
 And he built this inflated Dynamixel sort of robot

41
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,700
 with inflatable paws and an inflatable chest.

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,940
 And there was something-- he showed this at a humanoids

43
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,420
 conference that I was attending.

44
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,340
 And there was just something about the way

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,980
 that this is interacting with the little Mickey Mouse

46
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,860
 toy and the apple that at the time,

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,060
 when robots were going [MAKES RIDGID NOISE]

48
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,100
 with their rigid hands--

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,180
 this seemed so natural to me.

50
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,860
 This really captivated me.

51
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,060
 Having interactions like that with the world

52
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,620
 is potentially game-changingly different, in my opinion,

53
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,020
 than having these rigid objects that

54
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,860
 are trying to do exact perception

55
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,100
 and trying to be accurate.

56
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,260
 This is just a very different way to interact with the world.

57
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:05,060
 And Alex went on to build hands based on this kind of ideology.

58
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,540
 You could have bubbles as fingers.

59
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,900
 And you can imagine scaling that down.

60
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,700
 And actually, when TRI started, I was so captivated with this

61
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,460
 that I immediately recruited Alex to come start a soft

62
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,820
 robotics team at TRI.

63
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,300
 So he's the one that's behind the soft robotics stuff

64
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,980
 that I've shown you from TRI.

65
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,780
 And you'll see a few more of those.

66
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,160
 And he's just down the street.

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,060
 He was in the building earlier today.

68
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,860
 And he's a great guy.

69
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,380
 But this really, for me, was one of the first times

70
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,780
 where I thought, jeez, it's not just

71
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,300
 that that's a cool technology.

72
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,300
 But that really-- maybe I'm programming my robots wrong

73
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,260
 because we're touching things with these rigid fingers.

74
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,540
 And I should really be embracing the softness sooner rather

75
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,920
 than later because it might change

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,180
 my computational pipeline.

77
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:01,660
 So there's a lot of things that people say about soft.

78
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,300
 And it's like every soft robotics paper

79
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,700
 sort of starts off with a list of great things

80
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,260
 about being soft.

81
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,900
 But some of them, I think, are said a little too quickly.

82
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,500
 Or I just want to dig in with you a little bit

83
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,220
 about what is good and bad about being soft.

84
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:32,100
 So benefits of being soft, I guess.

85
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,100
 So one thing that people often say very quickly

86
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,180
 is that soft robots are inherently safe.

87
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:50,340
 Ironically, I had a conversation today

88
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,620
 about someone telling me how they were injured by a soft

89
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,120
 robot.

90
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,740
 But that was apparently in response

91
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,220
 to me saying I was going to say this in lecture.

92
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,940
 OK.

93
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,500
 But this is a standard sort of motivation for being soft

94
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 is that you can just sort of be inherently safe.

95
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,100
 But I want to question that a little bit

96
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,180
 and just make sure we understand that.

97
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,900
 Another big one that people talk about

98
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,700
 is that soft robots can be inherently less

99
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,660
 dependent on perception or geometric models,

100
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,220
 somehow be robust to-- in particular,

101
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,260
 people talk about the geometric uncertainty.

102
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:41,180
 So what do I mean by that?

103
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,660
 So the Mickey Mouse mouse little stuffed animal

104
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,100
 is not something that is like they have an accurate point

105
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,380
 cloud of that they're doing rigid point cloud

106
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,100
 registration of and estimating its pose in order to--

107
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,740
 they've got a simple scripted motion of the hand

108
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,260
 in that example or the apple.

109
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,420
 And they just kind of put the object roughly

110
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,300
 in the right spot.

111
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,980
 And they've got to put a different object roughly

112
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,740
 in the right spot.

113
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,340
 And it would have done pretty much the right thing.

114
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,220
 And that is probably quite different than what

115
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,940
 would have happened with a rigid hand.

116
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,940
 But again, I think we should dig in a little bit

117
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:19,140
 to why that happens or how broad that claim deserves to be.

118
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,700
 There's lots of other motivations out there.

119
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,700
 Some people say soft has the potential to be very durable.

120
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,940
 I think we're still--

121
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,180
 we're going through this revolution of fabrication

122
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,980
 technologies.

123
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,420
 And some of the early ones weren't that durable.

124
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,300
 But there's now-- you'll see videos

125
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,980
 of people driving over their soft robot with a car

126
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,060
 or hitting them with a hammer and stuff like that.

127
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,020
 That's standard fare for a soft robotics project.

128
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,380
 I've seen them-- you put it on the barbecue,

129
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,460
 and they light it on fire.

130
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,700
 And it's like, oh, my soft robot still works.

131
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,580
 That's cool.

132
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,300
 I think there is a real potential for them

133
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,300
 to be low cost, possibly even self-healing.

134
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:12,660
 I don't have as much to say about the fabrication

135
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,160
 part of it.

136
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,860
 But I do think that is an interesting motivation.

137
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,700
 And I think we are seeing--

138
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,620
 I mean, we have seen over the last 10 years,

139
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,620
 and we'll continue to see a revolution in fabrication

140
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,020
 that I think does strongly motivate soft robotics.

141
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,420
 But let's think about at least some of the first two

142
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,420
 a little bit more critically from a modeling and dynamics

143
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,260
 and control point of view.

144
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,140
 And the model-- the way I would love for you

145
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,220
 to think with me about this for a little bit

146
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,220
 is actually I think there's a very simple model that

147
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,780
 can get pretty far.

148
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,860
 So let's say I have an object to be--

149
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,980
 maybe it's on wheels if you want to think about it.

150
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,700
 I want objects that can only move horizontally.

151
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,620
 So we'll call this our manipuland.

152
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,700
 And we'll have our--

153
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,100
 maybe our hand.

154
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,860
 We have two hands.

155
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,140
 We'll do bimanual stuff.

156
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,620
 And because I like to keep the geometry simple,

157
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,700
 I'll have a point finger.

158
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,580
 [TAPPING]

159
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,040
 Right?

160
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:26,260
 And these things are only moving--

161
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,580
 the only degrees of freedom are left to right of the hands,

162
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,080
 right?

163
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,740
 And I want to manipulate the manipuland.

164
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,220
 And maybe you can see where I'm going here.

165
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,940
 I want to compare this version, which

166
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,140
 is a pretty rigid picture, and I'm just

167
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,620
 driving the hand around, with the same picture,

168
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,700
 but now if I have my point contact here

169
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,700
 and I attach my finger to my hand with a spring.

170
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,980
 And maybe it's even a spring and a damper

171
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,420
 if you like your mechanical drawings a little bit more

172
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,940
 complete.

173
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,180
 I could put a damper here between my hand and my finger.

174
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,100
 And my manipuland, right?

175
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,820
 Object is a little shorter to right.

176
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:29,700
 And let's think a little bit critically

177
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,900
 about the differences between those two systems, right?

178
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,820
 Can we actually say that a system that has a spring in it

179
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,380
 is inherently more safe, is inherently

180
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,060
 more robust to geometric uncertainty?

181
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,820
 Does it have all these attributes that we say?

182
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,580
 OK, so if I were to take this and write my rigid body

183
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,220
 mechanics for either of these two,

184
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,260
 and I were to now bring this hand in contact

185
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,980
 with the manipuland, then what happens?

186
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,660
 At the moment of contact-- let's maybe think about first

187
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,580
 the moment of contact.

 [WRITING ON BOARD]

189
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:22,180
 The rigid model is going to have an impulsive event, right?

190
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,940
 If this is strictly rigid and you're not

191
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,940
 allowed to penetrate, and you have a velocity

192
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,580
 before the contact and you're not

193
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,820
 allowed to have velocity after the contact,

194
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,660
 then you must have had an impulsive collision

195
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,700
 at the moment of contact.

196
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,460
 It could be elastic, it could be inelastic,

197
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,260
 but there's no question that something

198
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,620
 happened in zero time in order to keep you

199
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,460
 from going inside the object.

200
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,900
 So the rigid has an impulsive collision.

201
00:10:49,900 --> 00:11:04,500
 Now in this one, the purely soft one here,

202
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,580
 if I have a point finger here that is massless--

203
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,660
 if I assume for a minute it's massless,

204
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,540
 this is like assuming a spherical cow.

205
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,060
 It's very useful, but a little silly.

206
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:23,300
 Then if this is massless and I have a perfect spring here,

207
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,260
 then I don't have an impulsive collision.

208
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,760
 Right?

209
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:45,140
 So you could argue in that sense that maybe it's

210
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,700
 better for the object to not have that impulsive force that

211
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,260
 hits it all of a sudden.

212
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,340
 You can make those collisions larger or smaller

213
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,180
 depending on your momentum, I guess,

214
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,580
 at the moment of collision.

215
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,260
 But it is true that if you can remove that mass completely,

216
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,580
 then you get rid of the impulse.

217
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,500
 And really, I want to make sure that I'm clear.

218
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,060
 This is an artificial scenario.

219
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,820
 This never actually happens.

220
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,140
 Really, we always have something that looks more like this.

221
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,640
 Right?

222
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:30,740
 And we have some mass of my finger here.

223
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,900
 And we have some imperfect spring

224
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,940
 that has a stiffness k, maybe a damping b, let's say.

225
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,100
 And I have a mass of my hand here.

226
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,860
 OK.

227
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,100
 So this is the perfect model case.

228
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,140
 But I think in reality, we should be thinking rather,

229
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:10,420
 what is the relative mass of the finger before the spring

230
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,460
 and after the spring?

231
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:11,960
 Huh?

232
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:24,900
 OK, and then what is the relative spring constant,

233
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,060
 or relative stiffness?

234
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,940
 How large, how stiff is my spring?

235
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,440
 Right?

236
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,780
 And that, of course, only matters relative to the mass,

237
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:42,380
 again, to give you a total resonant frequency.

238
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,380
 Or all the characteristic dynamics

239
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,420
 are going to depend on the ratios of mass and the spring

240
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,340
 constant.

241
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,620
 OK, so I think the analogy to be more fair

242
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,820
 would be, how much benefit is it to have

243
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,780
 my mass of my finger particularly low

244
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,620
 in my stiffness low compared to the mass of my robot?

245
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,780
 And you could tell that in a design like this,

246
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,660
 this is trying to make the mass of the finger

247
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,460
 look more like the mass of the latex making the bubble,

248
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,860
 and the stiffness quite soft, where the bubble deflects

249
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,820
 easily and potentially over a large deformation

250
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,580

 At the moment of collision.

252
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,220
 That part seems reasonable?

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,580
 OK.

 Like, once I'm in collision now, and I'm

257
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:54,180
 applying some force on the hand here, from my whole robot,

258
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,660
 what forces can I apply in steady state?

 Once I've hit a rest length, my new rest length of the spring,

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,660
 then the forces I'm applying here

266

 are being completely imparted here.

267
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,660
 So in steady state, there's no difference, effectively.

 [WRITING ON BOARD]

269
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,420
 So if your robot has enough strength to crush, I guess,

270
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,620
 Mickey Mouse, then your soft robot has that strength,

271
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,220
 and your hard robot has that strength.

272
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,020
 So inherent safety maybe is not fair at steady state,

273
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,420
 I would say.

274
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,660
 And maybe even more importantly would

275
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,660
 be that springs can be dangerous.

276
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,120
 I mean, you can store energy in springs, right?

277
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,860
 So you could potentially take a pretty soft looking thing

278
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,380
 and kind of load it up, make it into a catapult,

279
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,180
 and fire off some pretty large forces if you're not careful.

280
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,500
 So I always balk a little bit when

281
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,180
 people say that soft is inherently safe.

282
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,940
 I think you have to do a little bit more

283
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,500
 to get safety from soft.

284
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,300
 Dissipation, I think, does inherently

285
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,580
 pull energy out of the system.

286
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,180
 If you have damping in your soft element, which

287
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,680
 most soft things do, then that pulls energy out.

288
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,980
 And that is inherently a stabilizing and maybe

 There's a trade off, of course, right?

 So if you do make these things soft,

 Let me just finish the thought real quick.

 But if my goal, in the linear system sense,

312
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,860
 if my goal is to make this execute,

313
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,660
 let's say, a sine wave trajectory,

314
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,460
 and I'd like to look at what my finger has

315
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,740
 to do as the frequency of that sine wave gets larger, right?

316
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,180
 The work that I'm going to have to do goes up fast

317
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,020
 if I have a very soft actuator.

318
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,300
 And what that implies, then, is that if somebody surprises you

319
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,180
 with a disturbance or something, your ability

320
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,100
 to respond and accurately control

321
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,060
 the high frequency behavior of this system is poor.

322
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,220
 Your control authority at high frequencies, I guess,

323
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,580
 is what really gets you, right?

324
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,300
 Because you've given up something with the softness,

325
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,780
 right?

326
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:23,420
 So if you have a hard robot, infinite bandwidth and control

327
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,460
 authority, then you should always

328
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,140
 be able to outperform a soft robot.

329
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,540
 You could always act like you're soft, right?

330
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,820
 So in practice, when we're putting this in,

331
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,900
 it's somehow admitting that our bandwidth is, in practice,

332
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,060
 limited in a meaningful regime.

333
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,980
 Sorry, yes, please.

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,180
 I'm wondering if there's another side of that point.

 Yeah.

336
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,140
 The bandwidth that's required to drive a soft robot

337
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,420
 is also lower than in a stiff case.

338
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,900
 Like, thinking about the task of grasping

339
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,500
 the egg with a rigid robot, you need instant bandwidth

340
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,580
 to not grasp that one perfectly rooted egg.

341
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,100
 Good.

342
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,420
 So you need-- you could probably do a one person

343
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,900
 control loop with a soft robot to get a really soft spring

344
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,500
 to still grasp the egg.

345
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,000
 Good.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,540
 So there was a comment for those hearing about,

347
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,300
 what if I'm trying to hold an egg, right?

348
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,780
 And I have an egg-like example coming in a minute.

349
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,460
 So yeah.

350
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,420
 Is it that maybe if I have a soft robot,

351
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,260
 the requirement on my bandwidth is less,

352
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,460
 and therefore I can get away with the softness?

353
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,220
 Yeah, I think I agree with the spirit of your comment.

354
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,700
 I might say that the task demands

355
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,300
 a certain amount of bandwidth.

356
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,020
 And many of the tasks we try to do with soft robots

357
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,940
 don't require high bandwidth, right?

358
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,860
 I might say it a little bit differently.

359
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,300
 But those two do play together.

360
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,460
 I think the place where soft wins

361
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,820
 is when your bandwidth requirements are low.

362
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,580
 And actually, probably for a lot of things

363
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,620
 we do in manipulation, our bandwidth requirements

364
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,780
 are very low, right?

365
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,180
 Certainly holding an egg, I wouldn't

366
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,100
 think would be a particularly high frequency thing, right?

367
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,260
 So if you're contacting it, it's a delta function,

368
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,460
 then what you would do is have a real high bandwidth

369
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,460
 to close the region.

370
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,380
 OK, great, great.

371
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,980
 So I said if you had a perfect stiff robot,

372
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,660
 couldn't you always do better?

373
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,740
 And so you're pointing out that a contact event is ideally

374
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,780
 a delta function in practice, because things

375
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,740
 aren't perfectly stiff.

376
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,540
 It's going to be a very short time event, right?

377
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,260
 So you're right.

378
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,340
 I think you need very high bandwidth

379
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,180
 to perform incredibly well through a contact event,

380
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,500
 like exceedingly high bandwidth.

381
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,620
 And so therefore, why try?

382
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,620
 Why not let the mechanical system

383
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,540
 handle that initial contact event,

384
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,340
 and then you do your thing after the fact?

385
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,100
 Completely agree.

386
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,820
 That's a very good way to think about it.

387
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,320
 OK.

388
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:52,740
 OK, so in this picture--

389
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,900
 I know a very simple picture, but I think hopefully

390
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,580
 a helpful picture--

391
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,980
 so we talked a little bit about the safety claim

392
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,340
 and maybe the bandwidth we mentioned quickly here.

393
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,700
 Is there a sense in which it's robust to geometric uncertainty

394
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,180
 in this picture, right?

395
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,340
 Is one sort of more or less robust

396
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,620
 to geometric uncertainty?

397
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,220
 I mean, that's a claim people--

398
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,020
 it's sort of easy to make when you see a video like this.

399
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,900
 How does it play out in this simple diagram?

400
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,900
.

401
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:50,940
 Yeah, please.

402
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,140
 I'm thinking about the case where you've already

403
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,740
 established a graph, and I'm thinking

404
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,180
 about varying the shape.

405
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,620
 In the soft state, I would expect

406
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,860
 some sort of conduit properties on the force.

407
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,540
 Like, if you establish a graph and you change the shape,

408
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,020
 the force should only change proportional to the change

409
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,540
 in shape.

410
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,140
 Because you're just changing the length of your spring,

411
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,820
 and that should change the force you're using.

412
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,540
 But if you have a completely rigid graph,

413
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,740
 and you establish it, and you shrunk the object a little bit,

414
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,780
 you expect a [INAUDIBLE]

415
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,260
 OK, good.

416
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,700
 So your thought experiment here, to summarize,

417
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,300
 is that imagine I'm in contact, and I've

418
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,420
 made a contact with my rigid or very stiff thing,

419
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,820
 and I suddenly shrunk or expanded the geometry.

420
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,740
 That's nice.

421
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,380
 Then, yeah, this is going to have--

422
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,260
 I mean, again, I guess this never exists, right?

423
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,860
 So we're in the very stiff case is more thoughtful.

424
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
 It could have a large reaction force

425
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,100
 that gets generated.

426
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,460
 So in some sense, your sensitivity of your controller

427
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,180
 might be higher because of this geometric uncertainty.

428
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,380
 I mean, I think even in the super simple case,

429
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,100
 if you thought this was a 2-centimeter wide brick,

430
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
 and it's actually a 1.9-centimeter brick,

431
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,340
 you could end up right here and just try to lift it up

432
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,380
 and completely miss.

433
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,740
 Or if you were trying to push inside it,

434
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,100
 you would be exerting very large forces

435
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,700
 and fighting against it.

436
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,200
 I agree.

437
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,940
 But I actually think the bigger case--

438
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,100
 let's see.

439
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,980
 I want to distinguish softness from position and force

440
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,900
 control.

441
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,900
 These are comparable ideas, and they're separable ideas.

442
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,100
 So once we have this idea that everything is--

443
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,940
 at least maybe the stiffness is very large if I have a kuka,

444
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,580
 with a metal exterior.

445
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,420
 But there's a stiffness there.

446
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,860
 And we always put at least a rubber pad or something

447
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,460
 between our metal and our contact.

448
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,340
 Position control, I think, is going

449
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,540
 to be vulnerable to geometric perception errors.

450
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,860
 But force control is pretty good.

451
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,620
 We saw examples of flipping up boxes

452
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,260
 without really estimating anything.

453
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,340
 And I think it's healthy in this picture

454
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,940
 to think about this as a force sensor.

455
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,420
 In fact, most force sensors are somehow

456
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,180
 having some material of known stiffness,

457
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,020
 and you're measuring the deflection of that material.

458
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,380
 If you have a known spring stiffness,

459
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,940
 and you can measure this deflection,

460
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,220
 then you've got a force sensor.

461
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,980
 So I think in this simple picture,

462
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,580
 you can achieve robustness to geometry

463
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,260
 just by being in a force control mode

464
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,340
 instead of being in a position control mode.

465
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,060
 And I think maybe, in my mind, the argument

466
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,180
 for geometric robustness is somehow not as great.

467
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,940
 I could do this.

468
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,500
 Maybe my ability to do force sensing

469
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,780
 might be more or less, depending on k.

470
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,540
 But I don't think I need to be a bubble to be better

471
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,820
 immune to perception errors.

472
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,540
 So let's make our diagram a little bit more rich,

473
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,220
 because I do think geometric robustness is a real thing.

474
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,580
 But I think we need a more expressive picture to see it.

475
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:37,100
 OK, so I hope you're OK with these sort of silly diagrams.

476
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:46,260
 OK, let's say I've got my hand, my object, my hand here.

477
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,020
 And instead of one point finger, let's

478
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,420
 make an entire array of point fingers.

479
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:05,100
 They can have dampers, too.

480
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,660
 And on this side, too, of course.

481
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:14,220
 Now things get more interesting.

482
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:22,820
 So let's say I start squeezing my hand together.

483
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:30,020
 And let's say I'm large k, the stiff regime.

484
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:38,260
 And I don't know-- I mean, in this case,

485
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,020
 I haven't even given my hand the ability

486
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,300
 to do well with a lot of geometric information.

487
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,940
 But-- or if I just had geometric uncertainty,

488
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,900
 and I was choosing my pose as I was coming in,

489
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,580
 you could get a similar picture.

490
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,420
 Well, let's think about the type of contact

491
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,000
 that you'd get if you just start squeezing your hand together,

492
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,500
 and you have a pretty stiff set of springs.

493
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,060
 I think it'd be pretty easy to-- let me exaggerate it here.

494
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,900
 Like, I've got some object here.

495
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,780
 It'd be pretty easy to get in a situation

496
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:15,180
 where you're in contact sort of in one or two places here.

497
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:22,460
 You know, the first part of your weird finger-looking thing

498
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,420
 is in contact.

499
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,500
 And the rest of them, they're sort of no contact.

500
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,000
 Right?

501
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,940
 Is that picture clear?

502
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,660
 OK.

503
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,220
 Now, the picture, of course, changes.

504
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:47,060
 If I'm in a very soft regime, you

505
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:52,460
 could imagine for some stiffnesses and some objects

506
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,300
 or whatever being in a situation where

507
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,140
 the same forces that produced this situation in a stiff

508
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,140
 regime could produce this very different situation

509
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,540
 in a soft regime, where you might have a larger force there

510
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,700
 because it's compressed the spring more,

511
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,140
 but I'll have forces everywhere.

512
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,220
 Maybe proportionate.

513
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,380
 I should be more careful to make them proportional,

514
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,140
 but I think you get my drift.

515
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,620
 OK.

516
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,660
 So why does that matter?

517
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,340
 Well, let's say we're going to start lifting the object up,

518
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,980
 if our goal is to lift the object up.

519
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,780
 What amount of squeezing force do

520
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,660
 I need to apply in order to successfully lift the object up?

521
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,340
 I need to have enough vertical force to fight gravity.

522
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,420
 Every one of my contacts is limited by friction.

523
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:58,300
 So at every point of contact here,

524
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,620
 I've got some friction cone.

525
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:05,380
 Maybe they're uniform everywhere

526
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,900
 in this first example here.

527
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,620
 In order to successfully--

528
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,580
 I've got the same thing happening on this side.

529
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,080
 Right?

530
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:23,820
 In order to successfully achieve lift-off,

531
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,820
 the vertical component of my force coming up here,

532
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,780
 which has to stay inside the friction cone

533
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,340
 if I don't want to slip, is going to be limited.

534
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,940
 My force tangential is going to be

535
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:43,020
 less than or equal to mu of my force normal

536
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,660
 by the static friction law.

537
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,160
 Right?

538
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,220
 That's my friction cone.

539
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,720
 OK.

540
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,820
 I'm going to have to squeeze hard.

541
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,740
 In this regime, I might have to squeeze hard

542
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,860
 in order to achieve enough friction in order

543
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,420
 to get up high.

544
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,900
 In this regime, where I have more possible contacts,

545
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,100
 I can potentially, even with the same material properties,

546
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,620
 the same friction properties, I could potentially

547
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,900
 squeeze less to achieve the same lift-off.

548
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,400
 OK.

549
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,420
 Now, that could have stability implications

550
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,300
 in a number of different ways.

551
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,900
 But it seems at least indicative that maybe this

552
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,180
 would be a better grasp.

553
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:30,380
 I think the real picture is actually more subtle than that.

554
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
 Right?

555
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,300
 I kind of tried to pick arrows to draw

556
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,660
 that were roughly landing on the normal surfaces there.

557
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,900
 But I mean, I've also got some contacts, potentially,

558
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,540
 here that have friction cones that

559
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,780
 are using the same coefficient of friction,

560
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,740
 but potentially on very different normals.

561
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,780
 Right?

562
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,900
 And I think, actually, the world of possible contact forces

563
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
 opens up pretty quickly.

564
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:05,540
 So now I'm firmly in the camp where

565
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,180
 if I can contact an object like this,

566
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,580
 with a whole, in the continuum, a whole patch of contact

567
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,820
 instead of a point contact, then my ability

568
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,180
 to manipulate the object seems improved.

569
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,620
 Let me be careful.

570
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,820
 You could still argue the counterpoint

571
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,100
 that you've given something up.

572
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,600
 Right?

573
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,300
 If you wanted to somehow explicitly control the contact

574
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,420
 forces, and you're making contact

575
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,580
 in all these different places with all

576
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,780
 these different normals, then to be

577
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,340
 able to regulate exactly the normal force

578
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,880
 might be almost impossible now, because you wouldn't be able

579
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,900
 to know exactly what forces.

580
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,820
 But to achieve some sufficient force to pick it up,

581
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,340
 or to resist a wrench, that would

582
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,940
 be another standard thing, would be if someone came and knocked

583
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,940
 this, how likely is it to pop out of my hand,

584
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,260
 or something like this.

585
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,180
 A grasp that has substantial patch contact

586
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,980
 seems like a better grasp most of the time.

587
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,300
 [SIDE CONVERSATION]

588
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:15,780
 OK, so I think, for me, the difference from point contact

589
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:23,660
 to surface, or people call it patch, contact patches,

590
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,900
 contact, is a really big deal.

591
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:33,180
 And I think that's where a lot of the benefits of softness

592
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,580
 for geometric robustness and the like come from.

593
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,100
 And I think it's what kind of captured my imagination when

594
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,020
 I saw these videos, right?

595
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,520
 Is that you just really didn't have

596
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,820
 to know the pose of the object.

597
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,580
 You didn't even have to know where it was.

598
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,300
 But you're going to have this like huggable, loving embrace,

599
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,820
 almost automatically, with like an open loop arm motion.

600
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,860
 It's pretty good.

601
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:10,940
 Let me go out of order, because I screwed up.

602
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,300
 So I guess one more point before I go on

603
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,620
 to the sensing aspect of it.

604
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,900
 Let's compare back in these pictures here.

605
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,300
 Maybe I'll work with this one.

606
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:31,020
 Let's compare sensing or stiffness of the spring,

607
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,940
 let's say, right at the skin versus something more distal.

608
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,500
 So I've talked about EWA having elastic joints.

609
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,220
 And when we talked about-- and some of you

610
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,780
 have been asked in your project, how do I do contact sensing?

611
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,780
 How do I know when I'm in contact with the wall,

612
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,620
 for instance, if I'm writing or something like this,

613
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,380
 with the EWA?

614
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,140
 And the answer is, you look at the joint torques,

615
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,500
 the external torques on the joint.

616
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,460
 That's where your contact sensors are on EWA.

617
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,340
 You could, of course, take your EWA

618
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,900
 and put another sensor at the end,

619
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,100
 or in the hand, or something.

620
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,300
 But by default, the EWA gives you some ability

621
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,460
 to do it in the joints.

622
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,900
 So what is the picture difference here?

623
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,220
 So maybe I have my skin, if I will,

624
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,740
 down here with a low mass, and a k here.

625
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:29,540
 And then I've got my finger, or my distal links.

626
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:35,500
 And then I have my elbow or something up here,

627
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,860
 or my main forearm, a more distal link.

628
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,980
 I'm still just thinking about the one dimensional,

629
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,900
 easy to think about, mass spring damper sort of case.

630
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,580
 My claim is that if I were to put some sort of rubber tips

631
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,580
 or something on the end of the EWA,

632
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,980
 then I can do some amount of force control and sensing.

633
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,380
 And people do very successfully with EWA,

634
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,340
 using this as my force sensor.

635
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,020
 Using the fact that there's a stiffness in the joint,

636
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,540
 and this is my force sensor.

637
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,340
 And I'd like to sort of contrast that

638
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,580
 with if you were to try to put your softness and your sensor

639
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,060
 more co-located with the contact.

640
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,380
 And it's not-- I mean, it's a subtle argument

641
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,500
 that talks about bandwidth.

642
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,420
 It talks about all the things we talked about.

643
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,340
 And you can do it in the linear systems sense.

644
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,020
 But I think overall, there are, I think,

645
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,500
 advantages to having a contact sensor that

646
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,820
 is more co-located with the actual event,

647
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,820
 and keeping your actual initial contact mass very low.

648
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,660
 So this is something that when I showed you this video before

649
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,420
 from Terry, where he was using this bubble sensor that I was

650
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:04,940
 talking about to do writing, he had ignored the EWA joint

651
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,900
 sensors and was just demonstrating

652
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,500
 that using the skin as a contact force sensor

653
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
 was sufficient to close a control loop that

654
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,740
 would allow him to write on the board.

655
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,580
 So I think our tactile sensor's ability to do that

656
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,380
 and how do we close feedback loops,

657
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,300
 that's a growing technology.

658
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,620
 But I think it's an exciting one.

659
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:33,660
 I think we can potentially move our softness and our sensing

660
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,740
 closer and closer to the point of interest.

661
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:48,660
 OK, that's just one way to think about softness,

662
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,300
 and hopefully a helpful one.

663
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,740
 Let's think about the sensing aspect of it.

664
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,300
 So we have amazing skin.

665
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,300
 And I actually put a picture of the skin.

666
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,980
 Towards the end, we'll talk about what's

667
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,300
 missing from our robot sensors.

668
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,020
 But I guess my introduction--

669
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,860
 I studied it back when I was a grad student.

670
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,400
 I was in the neuroscience department,

671
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,260
 and I took the classes on the basic brain and cognitive

672
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,460
 science classes, where we learned about the sensory

673
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,340
 system and all of the incredible sensors

674
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,180
 you have in your fingertip, and everywhere,

675
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,100
 but especially your fingertips.

676
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,140
 So what are the possible signals we could get out

677
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,460
 of a tactile sensor on a robot?

678
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,980
 I mean, I used to--

679
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,740
 when I was working on walking, I would

680
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,020
 have been happy if I just had a reliable binary contact,

681
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:56,980
 no contact, binary switch.

682
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,260
 We did a lot of work in walking, just like,

683
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,660
 if you could just tell me with any higher accuracy

684
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,620
 when my foot hits the ground, I would already be happy.

685
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,380
 Maybe that's still a little bit true today.

686
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,500
 We've implied here that--

687
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,700
 and I think a common request would

688
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,100
 be to have some sort of force sensing

689
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,420
 from your tactile sensors.

690
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,260
 And I think there's a characteristically different

691
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:29,300
 amount of request from a sensor to give a normal force

692
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,900
 versus a sheer force.

693
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:40,300
 But there's other things, too.

694
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,660
 People have built robot sensors that

695
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:52,860
 try to estimate temperature, to estimate--

696
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,460
 we could talk about the physics of it,

697
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,980
 but to try to somehow recognize texture or roughness,

698
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,420
 for instance.

699
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,540
 These are all, if you wanted to--

700
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,620
 if I reached into a toolbox and wanted to find with my--

701
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,180
 I can't see inside the toolbox, and I

702
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,780
 wanted to use my exquisite tactile sensing

703
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,260
 to find the right wrench, let's say.

704
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,860
 If I feel something that doesn't feel very metal--

705
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,540
 I mean, metal feels cold and has a certain roughness.

706
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,780
 And I've got a strong signal, not just from the geometry,

707
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,380
 but also from all these other signals.

708
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,740
 So this would have been probably the beginnings

709
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,540
 of my list a few years ago.

710
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,340
 But something really did change fairly recently,

711
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,220
 where I think more and more we're thinking about--

712
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,900
 these are all things that you might think about when

713
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,380
 you think about tactile sensors as measuring a point.

714
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,740
 But if you like my silly diagram at the top there,

715
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,340
 I think there's really something to be

716
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:03,540
 said for thinking about tactile sensing as a geometry sensor,

717
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,700
 and possibly even a dense geometry sensor.

718
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:20,060
 And that was a pretty big change for me to think.

719
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,940
 Maybe even if I'm buttoning--

720
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,780
 I don't have any buttons on this shirt.

721
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,500
 But if I had a shirt with buttons

722
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,460
 and I wanted to button it, what do you

723
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,180
 think you're using with your fingertips?

724
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,780
 Are you trying to estimate the forces

725
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,460
 that you're applying to the button?

726
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,060
 Or are you getting a sense that the button's

727
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,980
 going through the hole by virtue of feeling

728
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,140
 some sort of geometry?

729
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,020
 I don't know if I completely know the answer,

730
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,980
 but it feels like a pretty good geometry.

731
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,100
 It feels like geometry is pretty important in a lot

732
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,260
 of the things, the thought experiments

733
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,060
 that Ted Adelson had me run through when we started

734
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,820
 talking a lot about this.

735
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,460
 And Ted, I think, had a great impact

736
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,780
 when he introduced this geometry view of tactile sensing, which

737
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,060
 I'm going back to my--

738
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,140
 here we go.

739
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:17,780
 So Ted introduced this-- well, with Kimo--

740
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,740
 introduced this sensor gel site.

741
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,540
 Many of you probably heard about it.

742
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,780
 But let me just sing its praises for a minute.

743
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,940
 So basically, they asked the question of,

744
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,180
 what happens if I put a camera behind the skin?

745
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,660
 How well could I do with that?

746
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,380
 And how could I make that really effective?

747
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,100
 And there's a couple subtleties about making that effective.

748
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,420
 So one of the things that makes that effective

749
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,420
 is you'd like to have the camera worry

750
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,620
 about the geometry of the contact,

751
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:55,060
 but not worry about all of the RGB complexity of the world,

752
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,300
 or the lighting conditions of the world,

753
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,940
 or anything like that.

754
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,800
 So what they did is they made this small gel layer, hence

755
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,140
 gel site.

756
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,700
 They found a nice way to paint the coatings, the top layer

757
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,740
 of this, so that when you depressed, let's say,

758
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,420
 an Oreo, hypothetically, onto this gel layer,

759
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,860
 the image from the other side was a beautiful rendering

760
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,820
 of the geometry of the contact, without all

761
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,940
 of the complexity of lighting conditions

762
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:33,740
 or the complexity of real world vision, let's say.

763
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,140
 So that's a reasonable thing to try to do.

764
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,820
 And what they showed was that it had a lot of really nice

765
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,300
 properties.

766
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,580
 So in Ted's lab, there's all kinds of different goos

767
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,140
 or whatever.

768
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,940
 And it's super fun.

769
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,860
 There's enough of it floating around MIT these days.

770
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,240
 You can probably get your hands on some

771
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,780
 and just start putting your own finger

772
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,700
 and put a dollar bill on there.

773
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,820
 You can see the hair on your finger

774
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:09,140
 or the grains of a dollar bill through this thing.

775
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,940
 And one of the reasons that it's nice that the RGB signal doesn't

776
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,820
 come through is that they were, at the time,

777
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:21,580
 doing strictly geometric reconstructions

778
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,980
 using photogrammetry.

779
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,940
 So in a controlled lighting situation,

780
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,940
 with the RGB of the world excluded,

781
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,580
 they could just put a red, green, and blue light

782
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,460
 in known locations and do a classic computer vision

783
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:42,380
 trick for extracting depth from that now colored image.

784
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,780
 And it's just awesome.

785
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,140
 You could just see everything.

786
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,900
 This is beautiful geometry sensor.

787
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,060
 That's a pretty big pad to be sticking on your fingertip.

788
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,460
 But people have been scaling it down.

789
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,180
 And I think the vision is that we'll

790
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,700
 have these things scaled down.

791
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:11,180
 So if you have dense geometry available,

792
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,740
 a dense geometry available in your fingertip,

793
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,700
 then I think it connects back pretty quickly

794
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,520
 to all of the things we already talked about

795
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,740
 in the geometric perception lectures.

796
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,140
 So as an example, remember we talked about Dart,

797
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,900
 where we had point cloud measurements coming in.

798
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,980
 We talked about non-penetration constraints.

799
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,580
 And then we did our real-time pose estimation and tracking.

800
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,060
 That was just one of the algorithms

801
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,740
 we talked about in the geometric perception.

802
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,860
 And that was based on this idea of having a depth camera that

803
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,620
 was looking at the scene.

804
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,700
 We got our point cloud.

805
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,060
 We also had our free space constraints,

806
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:56,540
 all these things you hopefully remember a bit about from Dart.

807
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,900
 If you have a dense geometry sensor in your fingertip,

808
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,580
 then it's like you just have one more incredible depth

809
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,260
 sensor available inside your finger.

810
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,900
 But it's got a short maximum range.

811
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,940
 That's OK.

812
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:17,140
 I mean, that gives it a lovable limitation, I guess.

813
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,900
 But it gives you information that's not

814
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,500
 available from other sensors.

815
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,980
 So when we started playing with Gelsight with TED,

816
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,180
 that was the point that we tried to make,

817
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,420
 Greg made, was that if you have a dense geometry

818
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,100
 sensor in your fingertip, it snaps right

819
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,020
 into the geometric perception pipelines.

820
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:42,380
 And you can do pose estimation, tracking,

821
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,660
 you name it, directly through your combination

822
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,620
 of head-mounted sensors and dense geometry

823
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,780
 sensors in your fingertips.

824
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,980
 So as an example of an application

825
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,060
 that was enabled by that, if you wanted

826
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:01,420
 to do an insertion that required some kinematic accuracy,

827
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,900
 and you wanted to track the position of the screwdriver

828
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,700
 that had to fit in a relatively small hole,

829
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,060
 then-- I mean, the first thing that happens,

830
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,940
 we've talked about before, is that whenever

831
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,140
 you start touching things, your head-mounted cameras often

832
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:18,020
 quickly get occluded by your hand.

833
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,580
 But even more so, you can get more accuracy

834
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,780
 from these very local dense sensors

835
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:28,540
 in order to take out any of the remaining uncertainty

836
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,620
 and do finer scale insertions.

837
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:39,020
 What's the difference between the left and the right

838
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,620
 [INAUDIBLE]

839
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,580
 This one's ignoring Gelsight, using Gelsight and ignoring

840
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,420
 Gelsight.

841
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,420
 Maybe it wasn't as profound as we had originally

842
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,540
 imagined when we made it, but this one is basically

843
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,540
 missing the hole, and this one's going to make the hole.

844
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,120
 By the way, why did it make the hole?

845
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:00,060
 I remember it being more profound,

846
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,860
 but that was the with and without Gelsight.

847
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:09,460
 That's one in a series of works that people

848
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,620
 have done with Gelsight.

849
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:17,740
 Alberto's lab has taken Gelsight and made a more robust version

850
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,860
 of it in Gelslim.

851
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:27,820
 You can see these similarly architected sensors.

852
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:33,380
 Gelslim has got a really--

853
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,820
 I mean, we used to rip the Gelsight off the finger

854
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,460
 all the time.

855
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:42,260
 Again, I love Gelsight, but let me just make the point.

856
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,020
 So it's kind of frustrating to have

857
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,740
 this exquisite geometry sensing right here,

858
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,020
 but then if you happen to reach in

859
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,020
 and it doesn't hit exactly where your sensor is,

860
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,220
 then not only are you blind, but you've ripped the sensor off.

861
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,620
 So that was kind of frustrating.

862
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:02,460
 And that was just the state of the sensor when it started.

863
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,420
 This one's got a much tougher fabric.

864
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:11,220
 It's removed all of the, I think, the frailty on the edges.

865
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,060
 It's still limited to making contact on the sensor.

866
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,140
 The geometry is also different.

867
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,220
 So the photogrammetry, I believe, is gone in this version.

868
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,020
 I think Rachel can correct me if I'm wrong,

869
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,580
 but I think they've switched mostly

870
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:32,540
 to doing depth reconstruction using deep learning approaches

871
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,980
 to reconstruction because the photogrammetry required

872
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,500
 a particular geometry of the red, green, and blue sensors.

873
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,840
 And that was constraining in the geometries

874
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,540
 that you could build your sensors.

875
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,300
 And this, I think, used a longer throw

876
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,100
 and gave up on the strict photogrammetry reconstruction.

877
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:52,700
 Is that true?

878
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,200
 Yeah.

879
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,420
 And the work here, by the way, is also awesome.

880
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,620
 I mean, not only did it use the tactile sensors,

881
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,020
 but it used it to do cool things,

882
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:09,140
 showing feedback control of where objects being moved

883
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,380
 were observed as requiring different action.

884
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,300
 And it even has, you could say, a task and motion planning

885
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,980
 level at the top to be very robust.

886
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:28,940
 This sensor here is also inspired by gel site.

887
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,900
 It's a different approach.

888
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,980
 Again, living with the two-fingered gripper

889
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:38,780
 is kind of limited but beautiful in what you can do.

890
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:44,500
 You can do a lot of things with a good brain and a simple hand.

891
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,340
 On the inside of this is a dot pattern.

892
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,340
 And we've got a depth camera inside here.

893
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,700
 So we actually have a connect--

894
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:58,660
 it's a PicoFlex inside here that is actually doing

895
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,820
 explicit depth reconstruction.

896
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,340
 And then we put dot patterns on here

897
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,100
 in order to get shear and other forces.

898
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,580
 And this is super robust.

899
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,980
 And we've done a lot of cool manipulation with it,

900
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,020
 including one of the things you do

901
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,260
 is you say, I'm immune to the transparency of wine glasses.

902
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,460
 And I'm subtle to the touch.

903
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,420
 So we can do things like stacking wine glasses.

904
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:32,660
 So I do think we're in this sort of series of very cool advances

905
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,220
 in sensing.

906
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:40,940
 The geometry sensing is part of the story.

907
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,540
 But we do actually have these other types of sensors.

908
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,500
 Or let's say camera-based geometry sensing

909
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,220
 is only part of this.

910
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,900
 I told you about Puno.

911
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,380
 This is just the hand on Puno.

912
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,620
 And we have this sort of bigger ambition

913
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:59,820
 of building out full Baymax-like humanoid that's

914
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,420
 making contact all over the place

915
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,620
 and using tactile sensing all over the body.

916
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,420
 This is the project that Alex is leading at TRI.

917
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,020
 And just as another example, there's

918
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,340
 a whole bunch of different ways to measure geometry or force,

919
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,860
 which, of course, if you know the stiffness of your sensor,

920
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,060
 are related.

921
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,860
 This one is an inductive sensing in the chest, actually.

922
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,060
 So when you are picking up a massive water

923
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,940
 bottle with your chest, then we have a sparser--

924
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,660
 I mean, humans also have a lot more density

925
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,660
 in their tactile sensing in the hands

926
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,820
 than in the other parts of their body.

927
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,460
 And so I think a simpler, cheaper technology

928
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,300
 is warranted.

929
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,860
 And even along the arms, we're just

930
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:51,180
 using pressure sensors in the air pockets covering the arms.

931
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,820
 Inductive sensing has been used.

932
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,780
 Capacitive sensing has been used.

933
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,060
 Resistive sensing-- basically, every possibility, right?

934
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:02,220
 Force-sensing resistors have been used often.

935
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,500
 They all have their different pros and cons.

936
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:13,220
 I'll try that one more time, just in case I get lucky.

937
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:19,860
 But maybe I don't get to show you the IIT iCub.

938
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,780
 I believe it's this one.

939
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,820
 Very cool initial sensing skin.

940
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,660
 I would say one of the most advanced systems-level

941
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,940
 integration of sensing skin technology on a humanoid robot

942
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,820
 is this from the Italian Institute of Technology,

943
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,420
 the iCub skin.

944
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,780
 I encourage you to check it out.

945
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:47,700
 They not only built nice tactile sensors that could be arrayed,

946
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,820
 but they just--

947
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,700
 just incredible engineering to make these huge arrays that

948
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,900
 could be formed to the skin of the body.

949
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,180
 And they just had a whole humanoid with beautiful skin.

950
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:05,380
 And there's videos of them applying forces and controlling

951
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,340
 the robot on a full humanoid.

952
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:08,980
 Extremely cool.

953
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:17,700
 CSAIL is a pretty-- or MIT is a pretty good place, I guess,

954
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,180
 for tactile sensing.

955
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,580
 Voytchek's group has also been doing novel tactile sensors.

956
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,100
 So this is one of a series of things

957
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,380
 where they've basically been sewing dense--

958
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,020
 I think this was FSR at the time--

959
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,620
 force sensitive material into fabric.

960
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,620
 And they have smart carpets now.

961
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,780
 They have smart gloves.

962
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,940
 And they have just great instrumentation.

963
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,980
 I think the possibilities for robots

964
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,380
 to be completely coated with dense sensors,

965
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,740
 for humans to have a more immersive VR/AR experience

966
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,540
 with these kind of sensors.

967
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,980
 I mean, tactile sensing is just, I think, finally coming of age.

968
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,700
 It's actually kind of weird that it took so long.

969
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,140
 Everybody has known forever how important tactile sensing is.

970
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,180
 And it just took a very long time.

971
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,220
 Ted used to say, I've got this great tactile sensor.

972
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,420
 And I go to the roboticists.

973
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,020
 And I say, I've got this great tactile sensor.

974
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,420
 And they're like, we don't know what to do with it.

975
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,580
 That's great information.

976
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,060
 And we don't know what to do with it if you gave it to us.

977
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,700
 So maybe, I guess, the roboticists

978
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,860
 are finally waking up.

979
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:34,180
 But let me-- I'll finish here by saying that the human skin is

980
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,020
 actually incredible.

981
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,020
 And there are many other things that you

982
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:43,740
 can do that the human skin does that we're not doing, I think,

983
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,220
 in most of our tactile sensing yet.

984
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,100
 So let me just point out a few subtleties

985
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,220
 in these tactile sensors.

986
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:56,100
 So I won't name all of my anatomy anymore.

987
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,660
 I don't think I could without--

988
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:03,660
 I mean, I remember all the corpuscles and Purkinje's

989
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,220
 and stuff, but just barely.

990
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:10,540
 Some of them measure force.

991
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,960
 Some of them measure temperature.

992
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,260
 Some of them measure vibration.

993
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,060
 So actually, the signal that you'd

994
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:20,540
 get if I were to try to measure the roughness of this,

995
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,300
 there's a part of it, possibly, that

996
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,180
 is about the spatial forces that you feel along your finger.

997
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,660
 And the fact that your skin has curves and stuff

998
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,220
 certainly matters.

999
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,980
 But there's also a big part of your signal

1000
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,900
 that comes in the time domain.

1001
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,780
 Then you have high frequency vibrations

1002
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:41,340
 that are actually a strong indicator of the roughness

1003
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,380
 of your fabric and stuff like that.

1004
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,900
 So these are things that are totally

1005
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,540
 baked into our human sensing.

1006
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,220
 I mean, people talk about it in research,

1007
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,380
 but I think they're not mainstream in robotics yet.

1008
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:18,500
 So I do think robustness is less of an issue now,

1009
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:27,820
 but it's still an issue, I think, as is surface area,

1010
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,540
 or let's say surface coverage.

1011
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:37,060
 This story I said of somehow ripping off a gel site

1012
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,860
 or reaching into the toolbox and having

1013
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,980
 the first contact between my hand and the world

1014
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,580
 be not where my sensor happens to have incredible resolution,

1015
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,380
 but somehow on the edge of the sensor where

1016
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,060
 I had some plastic housing.

1017
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,780
 And actually, that's the part that almost always

1018
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,940
 bumps into things first.

1019
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,100
 These are still, I think, practical issues that are

1020
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,540
 getting better and better, but they're still real.

1021
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:13,940
 Sensing slip is a super interesting one.

1022
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,260
 Everybody thinks if I have tactile sensing,

1023
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,340
 then I can be more robust because I

1024
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,780
 can sense when things slip.

1025
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,820
 Actually, Francois had a great example of it.

1026
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,780
 He really wanted to close the feedback loop on slip.

1027
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,940
 That was the project with the ABB arm in Alberto's lab.

1028
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:39,020
 And I remember him saying at his defense, it's just too hard.

1029
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:44,340
 Basically, slip happens fast.

1030
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,740
 Slip is an instantaneous event, I guess.

1031
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,340
 You've gone from static friction to a sliding friction regime.

1032
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,820
 And in most cases, with the bandwidth

1033
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,740
 of our sensing plus control, by the time something slips,

1034
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,500
 it's too late.

1035
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,140
 So people talk a lot about--

1036
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,860
 so I've seen very few successes of control systems

1037
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,220
 that react to a slip in order to recover.

1038
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:12,460
 People talk about trying to predict slip.

1039
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,380
 They talk-- there's a notion of incipient slip,

1040
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,340
 where you're on the verge of slipping,

1041
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,880
 and you try to detect pre-slip events and avoid them

1042
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,460
 and stuff like this.

1043
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,020
 But I think it's too much to say that tactile sensing gives you

1044
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,620
 the ability to recover from slip.

1045
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,340
 And maybe in very--

1046
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,300
 like if something slides extremely slowly out

1047
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,700
 of my hand, then maybe.

1048
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:37,100
 But blocks falling out of my grasp and stuff

1049
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,060
 happens pretty fast.

1050
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:46,980
 And there are a few others that are--

1051
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,480
 this is just my random list of other things I wanted to say.

1052
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,620
 Sorry.

1053
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,860
 But I've always wondered--

1054
00:59:52,860 --> 01:00:02,260
 and people have often talked about proximity sensing

1055
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:06,740
 versus contact sensing.

1056
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,580
 And there's been projects through the years

1057
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,700
 that pop up and produce a new proximity

1058
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,020
 sensor versus contact sensor.

1059
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:15,660
 So as humans, our tactile sensing

1060
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,340
 is limited that we don't feel things until they actually

1061
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,660
 make contact with us.

1062
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,220
 Almost.

1063
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,260
 We do have hair as mammals.

1064
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:30,860
 So we do actually get a little bit from that.

1065
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,940
 And it's interesting that you should

1066
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,140
 think about what signal your hair is good for.

1067
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,740
 I think it's not only for warmth and other things,

1068
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,020
 but you can maybe tell if there's something coming

1069
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,180
 by a little bit of aerodynamics on your hair.

1070
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,300
 You can certainly feel as your hair is bent out of the way.

1071
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,420
 It's pretty amazing stuff that happens here

1072
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,860
 because of this instrumentation at the bottom of your hair

1073
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,700
 follicles.

1074
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,620
 But there's really--

1075
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,540
 I mean, we talked about gel sites having a limited throw

1076
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,700
 at the skin, and that being a good thing in terms

1077
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,380
 of making the sensing simpler.

1078
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,660
 But why shouldn't our robots go ahead and detect something

1079
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,080
 before it makes contact?

1080
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,140
 Why shouldn't we bury in our skin

1081
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:15,700
 things that sense the approach of something,

1082
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,740
 the proximity of something?

1083
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,620
 It's interesting.

1084
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:24,060
 It just seems like an obviously good thing to do.

1085
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,580
 And it hasn't really taken off.

1086
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,140
 I mean, I could list a couple of possible reasons why.

1087
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,740
 I don't know if people here know why.

1088
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,500
 But I mean, I think it is--

1089
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,220
 I've heard from people that do it that it's

1090
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,580
 hard to make a proximity sensor that works uniformly

1091
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,380
 for all types of objects, like to have something that would

1092
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,860
 respond to a metal and a wood and whatever,

1093
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,580
 like a lot of technologies that are behind the skin

1094
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:48,220
 and are using non-vision-based techniques

1095
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:52,580
 are sensitive to material properties.

1096
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,460
 Some things are magnetic or whatever.

1097
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,580
 But I wouldn't be surprised if in a few years

1098
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,700
 we are sensing contact before it happens.

1099
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,500
 It seems like just an obviously good idea.

1100
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,580
 OK.

1101
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,900
 So that was a--

1102
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,940
 I didn't do my chip demo.

1103
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,460
 But I thank you for bringing the chips, by the way.

1104
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,900
 I was just going to make the point

1105
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,020
 that I could squeeze a potato chip in a rigid object,

1106
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:20,820
 and it would break.

1107
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,500
 And I could squeeze it in this.

1108
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
 I'll at least squeeze it in this.

1109
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,580
 It's the distributed contact point, right?

1110
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:31,260
 So this is the standard thing, would be the egg.

1111
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,340
 It's good for the egg.

1112
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,780
 It's good for the potato chip.

1113
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,340
 It's not just like I can produce more forces.

1114
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,660
 But it's pretty nice to sort of distribute the load

1115
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,980
 across an entire surface.

1116
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:44,540
 It's good for the object you're hugging, too, right?

1117
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,860
 I could put a lot of force, normal force on this,

1118
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,860
 and the chip's fine.

1119
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,700
 And I've got a few broken chips from playing

1120
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,980
 with my rigid clamp just before lecture,

1121
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,420
 and some grease on my fingers.

1122
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,220
 Yes?

1123
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,660
 So the question that I have is we

1124
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,580
 started off talking about all these really cool open loop

1125
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,260
 achievements with software like things

1126
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:07,300
 like the thing manipulates the cube without any feedback.

1127
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,740
 What was the gap that led to all this tactile [INAUDIBLE]??

1128
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,620
 We get all these great results with remote.

1129
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,140
 Yeah.

1130
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,940
 I mean, for a long time, and maybe even still today,

1131
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:19,700
 like the soft robotics journals, wherever,

1132
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,300
 there's incredible fabrication technology, incredible results.

1133
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,660
 I can hit my thing with a hammer.

1134
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,420
 I can put it on the charcoal grill.

1135
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,300
 And then it says control is future work, right?

1136
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,100
 Sorry.

1137
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,820
 I think it's still true.

1138
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,260
 But everybody knows that you should do control.

1139
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,380
 I think the things you can do in open loop

1140
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:45,660
 are enveloping grasps work really, really well.

1141
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,100
 But there's a whole bunch of things in manipulation

1142
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,580
 that is more than enveloping grasps.

1143
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,300
 That's been a theme over the--

1144
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,420
 if you wanted to do the type of stuff, even the bottle turning,

1145
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,380
 the stuff that Rachel was showing,

1146
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:59,660
 or any number of things we've shown over the term,

1147
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,980
 you've got to do something more than just the open loop

1148
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:02,980
 stable.

1149
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,460
 You want to be able to react to your environment,

1150
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:10,460
 dig into the toolbox, and find the wrench.

1151
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,940
 There's all kinds of motivations for that.

1152
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:17,340
 I do think that we don't have all those pieces.

1153
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,900
 I mean, deep learning-- so geometric perception

1154
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,100
 works well with tactile, once you have dense geometry.

1155
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,140
 You can combine-- also in the deep pipeline,

1156
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,740
 you can bring your tactile sensors in,

1157
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,140
 especially if they're dense geometry,

1158
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:31,340
 and you can put them through a convolutional network.

1159
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,820
 And that works pretty well.

1160
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,580
 Yunzhu in our group has done some pretty incredible things

1161
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,100
 with that.

1162
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,460
 Other people have as well.

1163
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,060
 So I think it's coming.

1164
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,540
 But we haven't seen, I think, its full power yet.

1165
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:49,660
 Yes?

1166
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,660
 So I'm curious.

1167
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:54,660
 You said we-- that you get more capabilities if we have proximity

1168
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,160
 sensors.

1169
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,160
 But I'm just having a hard time imagining what

1170
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,160
 you'd be able to do with proximity sensors that you

1171
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,660
 couldn't already get with a hand-mounted camera,

1172
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,660
 besides avoiding occlusion.

1173
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,660
 Good question.

1174
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,660
 So what about proximity versus a hand-mounted camera?

1175
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:13,460
 But I think hand-mounted cameras have been less useful

1176
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,260
 than I expected.

1177
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,740
 And I think the-- certainly depth cameras

1178
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,660
 have a maximum range, and they also have a minimum range.

1179
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:20,860
 And that minimum range--

1180
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,780
 oftentimes, when you talk to the manufacturers,

1181
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:23,940
 they're like, well, we just never--

1182
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,100
 nobody ever asked us to make a shorter minimum range.

1183
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,260
 We were always worried about pushing out the maximum,

1184
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,700
 never shortening the minimum.

1185
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,460
 So there's probably hardware improvements

1186
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,060
 that, if it became a priority, could be done.

1187
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:37,660
 But even RGB techniques, it seems

1188
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:40,540
 like, once you get pretty close, the RGB signal

1189
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,540
 is just not as good.

1190
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,060
 Maybe your camera is getting blurry,

1191
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:47,340
 but also just the field of view is very small.

1192
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,140
 So there-- and then, once you're in contact,

1193
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:52,460
 I think you can start getting local but interesting geometry

1194
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:52,980
 again.

1195
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,060
 But there seems to be this intermediate space, where

1196
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,860
 you're too close for a camera to be super useful.

1197
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:02,660
 You're not touching in contact yet.

1198
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:08,420
 So maybe we will have cameras looking out all over our bodies.

1199
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:09,620
 That's a possible future.

1200
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:11,140
 And maybe-- and just--

1201
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,980
 and rely on the RGB.

1202
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:15,780
 And maybe, just because the price point of iPhones

1203
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,220
 bringing down cameras and stuff, maybe that's the reason--

1204
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,060
 that's the way it's going to go.

1205
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:23,420
 It's a good question.

1206
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,700
 OK.

1207
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,820
 The big points-- I think you can think a lot

1208
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:31,220
 about the mechanics of softness, the benefits or trade-offs

1209
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,940
 of softness, even with linear spring mass damper systems.

1210
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,400
 I really think that a lot of people

1211
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,980
 have used that kind of model to great effect

1212
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,980
 to think about the pros and cons of softness.

1213
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,780
 The real world has more interesting geometry

1214
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:47,340
 and the like, but a lot of the lessons transfer.

1215
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:50,420
 And the fact that tactiles can be a geometry sensor,

1216
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,980
 I think, is just a really cool connection to the type of tools

1217
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,140
 we've already talked about.

1218
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,740
 You can do pose estimation tracking,

1219
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,380
 but you can also do shape estimation.

1220
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,460
 There's object detection.

1221
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,380
 All of the sort of classical perception techniques

1222
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:05,260
 you can think about doing with tactile.

1223
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,740
 It's a little different because you

1224
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:10,940
 have very local features as opposed to global features,

1225
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,540
 but the same kind of ideas work.

1226
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:22,340
 All right, so let me end by just kind of giving an overview,

1227
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,900
 kind of a wrap-up of what we've done over the term,

1228
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,100
 just to put a bow on it here.

1229
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,460
 OK.

1230
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,500
 We've done a lot of things.

1231
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,260
 And I appreciate-- I mean, I sort of

1232
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:41,460
 feel like the class is taking material that maybe should be

1233
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,380
 is still sort of like research seminar class,

1234
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:47,220
 and it's trying to present it as a textbook class.

1235
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:49,760
 And we're somewhere in between, and there's some rough edges,

1236
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,020
 and I appreciate your patience.

1237
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,340
 But it's pretty fun to sort of be

1238
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:56,500
 in a field that's kind of on the verge of those two things.

1239
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,980
 So let's just lay the landscape a little differently

1240
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,940
 than I did in the chapters, just to think about that.

1241
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:17,260
 So we talked about kinematics, dynamics, simulation.

1242
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:21,220
 That was definitely a big theme.

1243
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:24,980
 In simulation, I emphasized the signals and systems

1244
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,420
 view of the world.

1245
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,540
 And some of you hate that this week.

1246
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:34,260
 But it's good.

1247
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:38,900
 No, I mean, but I do think that to scale

1248
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,180
 to very complex systems.

1249
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:43,420
 I mean, you hear from the big players that

1250
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,540
 are trying to build these massively complex systems

1251
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:49,700
 and have a level of robustness, that somehow that way

1252
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:53,700
 of arranging all the different components together

1253
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,420
 is, I think, a very scalable and robust.

1254
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,420
 I mean, Simulink is not a successful product

1255
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,660
 for so many years without reason.

1256
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,260
 And I think in manipulation, everything snaps in two.

1257
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,820
 We're seeing that over and over again.

1258
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,620
 So you got a taste of that.

1259
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,340
 I hope you didn't dislike it too much.

1260
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:22,140
 And then we had sort of the manipulator view of the world,

1261
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:27,460
 where we talked about the manipulator control ideas

1262
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:35,460
 from differential IK to force control and hybrid control

1263
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,700
 to stiffness control.

1264
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:42,540
 That's about how do you move your arm around,

1265
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:45,820
 ignoring all the complexity of the world,

1266
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,540
 regulate forces and the like.

1267
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:50,260
 We talked about planning sort of in that view of the world

1268
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:56,780
 too, about RRTs, trajectory optimization.

1269
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:03,900
 And that was-- our focus in the planning

1270
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:08,060
 was, again, about sort of the robot's view of the world

1271
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,620
 with its eyes closed.

1272
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,620
 How do you get from point A to point B?

1273
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,500
 If you've brought in some obstacles,

1274
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,060
 maybe you're going to plan around the obstacles.

1275
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:19,820
 But it was thinking mostly about the motion of the robot,

1276
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,180
 not the motion of the world.

1277
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:31,140
 We, of course, talked a bunch about perception with a big--

1278
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,900
 I wanted to emphasize first some of the geometry

1279
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:43,260
 and the geometric perception from ICP, Dart, et cetera,

1280
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,260
 for pose estimation.

1281
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,620
 But we also talked a bit about dense reconstructions.

1282
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,060
 That came up a bunch.

1283
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:55,340
 I never spent a lecture on it, but it kept coming up.

1284
01:10:55,340 --> 01:11:00,700
 And then, of course, the revolution in perception

1285
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:07,860
 that's come from deep learning, segmentation,

1286
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:14,460
 pose estimation, but also new representations.

1287
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:26,660
 I think the thing I'm most excited about with the deep

1288
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,500
 learning approaches is that we can get fundamentally--

1289
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,500
 we don't have to go all the way through to pose.

1290
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,940
 And we can potentially estimate much less than a full shape

1291
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,620
 or pose estimation algorithm.

1292
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,900
 Maybe it's just the key points.

1293
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,060
 That was a simple example.

1294
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:43,020
 But maybe it's just some latent representation

1295
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,700
 that isn't even human intelligible that

1296
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,380
 comes out of a deep learning system,

1297
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,940
 but is enough to do good control.

1298
01:11:47,940 --> 01:12:01,420
 And then when we talked about controlling--

1299
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,500
 moving the actual objects in the world,

1300
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:08,540
 affecting the world more, when we got deeper into that,

1301
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:11,540
 the major approach we talked about was RL.

1302
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:26,660
 We did it before, of course, by relatively simple--

1303
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:29,260
 I'm going to come into contact, close my hand,

1304
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,180
 and go like this.

1305
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,980
 But when we started getting richer emphasis

1306
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:37,540
 on the control of the environment,

1307
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:50,420
 we started talking mostly about RL, reinforcement learning,

1308
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,660
 and all of its different variants.

1309
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:56,460
 But maybe slightly more general, I

1310
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,860
 tried to emphasize the general awesomeness of, I think,

1311
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:02,100
 visual motor policies.

1312
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:07,700
 And whether you get them from RL or imitation learning

1313
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:13,180
 or model-based RL or model-free RL,

1314
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,980
 I think the opportunity to connect

1315
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:22,700
 these types of rich sensing, possibly

1316
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,660
 through novel representations, directly to control policies

1317
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:26,660
 is just so awesome.

1318
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,380
 And it's something that we're going

1319
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:33,140
 to see more and more of.

1320
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:36,100
 We talked about high-level task planning.

1321
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:44,340
 Rachel gave a great lecture last week.

1322
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:47,620
 We talked about it a little bit early on,

1323
01:13:47,620 --> 01:14:05,940
 from strips and PDIDL, state machines, and behavior trees,

1324
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,300
 and then TAMP last week.

1325
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:12,780
 Actually, I told Rachel after her lecture

1326
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:16,020
 that watching her talk about it, I really--

1327
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:20,460
 I think next year, I think this has got to be even a more

1328
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:21,580
 core piece of the class.

1329
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,900
 I think we've got to move it up.

1330
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,280
 And it's just such an important piece of the manipulation

1331
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,300
 pipeline to scale to much more complicated tasks.

1332
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,860
 I think I felt really inspired by that.

1333
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,620
 So those are, in my mind, the core components

1334
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,140
 that we've been talking about.

1335
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,660
 And we've talked tactile and other things have added on,

1336
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:43,700
 I hope, some elements.

1337
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,500
 But like I say, it's pretty fun to be in a place

1338
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,940
 right now where it sort of feels like we have a curriculum

1339
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:53,460
 for manipulation.

1340
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:57,660
 And those tools will get more and more mature.

1341
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,100
 And the core concepts will be more and more mature.

1342
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,380
 And I hope that maybe there's value.

1343
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,180
 I hope the value that this class can bring

1344
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:08,180
 is that trying to put these under sort of the same umbrella

1345
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:11,460
 and same symbols most of the time

1346
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:15,940
 and same code most of the time.

1347
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,420
 So I mean, I think the number one thing

1348
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:24,540
 I want you to walk away with is that it's a super vibrant

1349
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,700
 research community.

1350
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,540
 It's a super vibrant problem.

1351
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:30,460
 I mean, the number of people in industry

1352
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:34,180
 that care about manipulation is just skyrocketing.

1353
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,300
 I think the potential for it to maybe to get grand,

1354
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:43,380
 to shape the future of humanity, the future of work, life off

1355
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:44,700
 Earth, I don't know.

1356
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,180
 It's pretty important stuff.

1357
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,380
 Maybe there are other important things out there, too.

1358
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,860
 But this is pretty important.

1359
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,460
 So yeah, maybe this will be a foundation for you.

1360
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:57,820
 And I hope some of you continue on and push on and give us

1361
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:02,500
 feedback so that we can keep making the course better.

1362
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,300
 Good.

1363
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,620
 Well, your turn next.

1364
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:10,500
 So Thursday, we will do the project videos.

1365
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,380
 And I think everybody knows the deal.

1366
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,300
 But I hope many of you will come here to watch with us.

1367
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,860
 We'll do a viewing session.

1368
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,580
 We have the room till 5 if we need it.

1369
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:21,540
 And we'll get oohs and ahs and questions

1370
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,020
 if you're here to answer them.

1371
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,340
 And we have time.

1372
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,260
 And I'll see you then.

1373
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:27,860
 Thank you.

1374
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,700
 [APPLAUSE]
